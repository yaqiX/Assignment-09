Two households, both alike in dignity, n&#39;, &#39; In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, n&#39;, &#39; From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, n&#39;, &#39; Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. n&#39;, &#39; From forth the fatal loins of these two foes n&#39;, &#34; A pair of star-cross&#39;d lovers take their life; n&#34;, &#34; Whose misadventur&#39;d piteous overthrows n&#34;, &#34; Doth with their death bury their parents&#39; strife. n&#34;, &#34; The fearful passage of their death-mark&#39;d love, n&#34;, &#34; And the continuance of their parents&#39; rage, n&#34;, &#34; Which, but their children&#39;s end, naught could remove, n&#34;, &#34; Is now the two hours&#39; traffic of our stage; n&#34;, &#39; The which if you with patient ears attend, n&#39;, &#39; What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. n&#39;, &#39; [Exit.] n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39;ACT I. Scene I. n&#39;, &#39;Verona. A public place. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39;Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house n&#39;, &#39;of Capulet. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Samp. Gregory, on my word, we&#39;ll not carry coals. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. No, for then we should be colliers. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we&#39;ll draw. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. I strike quickly, being moved. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand. n&#39;, &#34; Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn&#39;st away. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take n&#39;, &#34; the wall of any man or maid of Montague&#39;s. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the n&#39;, &#39; wall. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Samp. &#39;Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, n&#34;, &#34; are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague&#39;s men n&#34;, &#39; from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Samp. &#39;Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have n&#34;, &#39; fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off n&#39;, &#39; their heads. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. The heads of the maids? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads. n&#39;, &#39; Take it in what sense thou wilt. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and &#39;tis known I n&#34;, &#39; am a pretty piece of flesh. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Greg. &#39;Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst n&#34;, &#39; been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of n&#39;, &#39; Montagues. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar]. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. How? turn thy back and run? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. Fear me not. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. No, marry. I fear thee! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is n&#39;, &#39; disgrace to them, if they bear it. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. [aside to Sampson] No. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my n&#39;, &#39; thumb, sir. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Greg. Do you quarrel, sir? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as n&#39;, &#39; you. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Abr. No better. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. Well, sir. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Benvolio. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say &#39;better.&#39; Here comes one of my n&#34;, &#34; master&#39;s kinsmen. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. Yes, better, sir. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Abr. You lie. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. n&#39;, &#39; They fight. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.] n&#39;, &#39; Put up your swords. You know not what you do. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Tybalt. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? n&#39;, &#39; Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword, n&#39;, &#39; Or manage it to part these men with me. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word n&#39;, &#39; As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee. n&#39;, &#39; Have at thee, coward! They fight. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or n&#39;, &#39; partisans. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come n&#39;, &#39; And flourishes his blade in spite of me. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Old Montague and his Wife. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, n&#39;, &#39; Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel- n&#39;, &#39; Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, n&#39;, &#39; That quench the fire of your pernicious rage n&#39;, &#39; With purple fountains issuing from your veins! n&#39;, &#39; On pain of torture, from those bloody hands n&#39;, &#39; Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground n&#39;, &#39; And hear the sentence of your moved prince. n&#39;, &#39; Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word n&#39;, &#39; By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, n&#39;, &#34; Have thrice disturb&#39;d the quiet of our streets n&#34;, &#34; And made Verona&#39;s ancient citizens n&#34;, &#39; Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments n&#39;, &#39; To wield old partisans, in hands as old, n&#39;, &#34; Cank&#39;red with peace, to part your cank&#39;red hate. n&#34;, &#39; If ever you disturb our streets again, n&#39;, &#39; Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. n&#39;, &#39; For this time all the rest depart away. n&#39;, &#39; You, Capulet, shall go along with me; n&#39;, &#39; And, Montague, come you this afternoon, n&#39;, &#39; To know our farther pleasure in this case, n&#39;, &#39; To old Freetown, our common judgment place. n&#39;, &#39; Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. n&#39;, &#39; Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio]. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? n&#39;, &#39; Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary n&#39;, &#39; And yours, close fighting ere I did approach. n&#39;, &#39; I drew to part them. In the instant came n&#39;, &#34; The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar&#39;d; n&#34;, &#34; Which, as he breath&#39;d defiance to my ears, n&#34;, &#39; He swung about his head and cut the winds, n&#39;, &#34; Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss&#39;d him in scorn. n&#34;, &#39; While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, n&#39;, &#39; Came more and more, and fought on part and part, n&#39;, &#39; Till the Prince came, who parted either part. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day? n&#39;, &#39; Right glad I am he was not at this fray. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp&#39;d sun n&#34;, &#34; Peer&#39;d forth the golden window of the East, n&#34;, &#39; A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; n&#39;, &#39; Where, underneath the grove of sycamore n&#39;, &#34; That westward rooteth from the city&#39;s side, n&#34;, &#39; So early walking did I see your son. n&#39;, &#39; Towards him I made; but he was ware of me n&#39;, &#39; And stole into the covert of the wood. n&#39;, &#39; I- measuring his affections by my own, n&#39;, &#39; Which then most sought where most might not be found, n&#39;, &#39; Being one too many by my weary self- n&#39;, &#34; Pursu&#39;d my humour, not Pursuing his, n&#34;, &#34; And gladly shunn&#39;d who gladly fled from me. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen, n&#39;, &#34; With tears augmenting the fresh morning&#39;s dew, n&#34;, &#39; Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; n&#39;, &#39; But all so soon as the all-cheering sun n&#39;, &#39; Should in the furthest East bean to draw n&#39;, &#34; The shady curtains from Aurora&#39;s bed, n&#34;, &#39; Away from light steals home my heavy son n&#39;, &#39; And private in his chamber pens himself, n&#39;, &#39; Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight n&#39;, &#39; And makes himself an artificial night. n&#39;, &#39; Black and portentous must this humour prove n&#39;, &#39; Unless good counsel may the cause remove. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. Have you importun&#39;d him by any means? n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mon. Both by myself and many other friend; n&#39;, &#34; But he, his own affections&#39; counsellor, n&#34;, &#39; Is to himself- I will not say how true- n&#39;, &#39; But to himself so secret and so close, n&#39;, &#39; So far from sounding and discovery, n&#39;, &#39; As is the bud bit with an envious worm n&#39;, &#39; Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air n&#39;, &#39; Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. n&#39;, &#39; Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, n&#39;, &#39; We would as willingly give cure as know. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Romeo. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside, n&#39;, &#34; I&#39;ll know his grievance, or be much denied. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay n&#39;, &#34; To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let&#39;s away, n&#34;, &#39; Exeunt [Montague and Wife]. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Good morrow, cousin. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Is the day so young? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. But new struck nine. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long. n&#39;, &#39; Was that my father that went hence so fast? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo&#39;s hours? n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Not having that which having makes them short. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. In love? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Out- n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Of love? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view, n&#39;, &#39; Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still, n&#39;, &#39; Should without eyes see pathways to his will! n&#39;, &#39; Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? n&#39;, &#39; Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. n&#39;, &#34; Here&#39;s much to do with hate, but more with love. n&#34;, &#39; Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! n&#39;, &#39; O anything, of nothing first create! n&#39;, &#39; O heavy lightness! serious vanity! n&#39;, &#39; Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! n&#39;, &#39; Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! n&#39;, &#39; Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is n&#39;, &#39; This love feel I, that feel no love in this. n&#39;, &#39; Dost thou not laugh? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. No, coz, I rather weep. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Good heart, at what? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. At thy good heart&#39;s oppression. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Rom. Why, such is love&#39;s transgression. n&#34;, &#39; Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, n&#39;, &#39; Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest n&#39;, &#39; With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown n&#39;, &#39; Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. n&#39;, &#34; Love is a smoke rais&#39;d with the fume of sighs; n&#34;, &#34; Being purg&#39;d, a fire sparkling in lovers&#39; eyes; n&#34;, &#34; Being vex&#39;d, a sea nourish&#39;d with lovers&#39; tears. n&#34;, &#39; What is it else? A madness most discreet, n&#39;, &#39; A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. n&#39;, &#39; Farewell, my coz. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Soft! I will go along. n&#39;, &#39; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here: n&#39;, &#34; This is not Romeo, he&#39;s some other where. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Groan? Why, no; n&#39;, &#39; But sadly tell me who. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will. n&#39;, &#34; Ah, word ill urg&#39;d to one that is so ill! n&#34;, &#39; In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. I aim&#39;d so near when I suppos&#39;d you lov&#39;d. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Rom. A right good markman! And she&#39;s fair I love. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She&#39;ll not be hit n&#34;, &#34; With Cupid&#39;s arrow. She hath Dian&#39;s wit, n&#34;, &#34; And, in strong proof of chastity well arm&#39;d, n&#34;, &#34; From Love&#39;s weak childish bow she lives unharm&#39;d. n&#34;, &#39; She will not stay the siege of loving terms, n&#39;, &#34; Nor bide th&#39; encounter of assailing eyes, n&#34;, &#39; Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. n&#39;, &#34; O, she&#39;s rich in beauty; only poor n&#34;, &#39; That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; n&#39;, &#34; For beauty, starv&#39;d with her severity, n&#34;, &#39; Cuts beauty off from all posterity. n&#39;, &#39; She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, n&#39;, &#39; To merit bliss by making me despair. n&#39;, &#39; She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow n&#39;, &#39; Do I live dead that live to tell it now. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. Be rul&#39;d by me: forget to think of her. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes. n&#39;, &#39; Examine other beauties. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Rom. &#39;Tis the way n&#34;, &#39; To call hers (exquisite) in question more. n&#39;, &#34; These happy masks that kiss fair ladies&#39; brows, n&#34;, &#39; Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair. n&#39;, &#39; He that is strucken blind cannot forget n&#39;, &#39; The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. n&#39;, &#39; Show me a mistress that is passing fair, n&#39;, &#39; What doth her beauty serve but as a note n&#39;, &#34; Where I may read who pass&#39;d that passing fair? n&#34;, &#39; Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. I&#39;ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39;Scene II. n&#39;, &#39;A Street. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39;Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I, n&#39;, &#34; In penalty alike; and &#39;tis not hard, I think, n&#34;, &#39; For men so old as we to keep the peace. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both, n&#39;, &#34; And pity &#39;tis you liv&#39;d at odds so long. n&#34;, &#39; But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Cap. But saying o&#39;er what I have said before: n&#34;, &#39; My child is yet a stranger in the world, n&#39;, &#39; She hath not seen the change of fourteen years; n&#39;, &#39; Let two more summers wither in their pride n&#39;, &#39; Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Cap. And too soon marr&#39;d are those so early made. n&#34;, &#39; The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; n&#39;, &#39; She is the hopeful lady of my earth. n&#39;, &#39; But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart; n&#39;, &#39; My will to her consent is but a part. n&#39;, &#39; An she agree, within her scope of choice n&#39;, &#39; Lies my consent and fair according voice. n&#39;, &#34; This night I hold an old accustom&#39;d feast, n&#34;, &#39; Whereto I have invited many a guest, n&#39;, &#39; Such as I love; and you among the store, n&#39;, &#39; One more, most welcome, makes my number more. n&#39;, &#39; At my poor house look to behold this night n&#39;, &#39; Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light. n&#39;, &#39; Such comfort as do lusty young men feel n&#39;, &#34; When well apparell&#39;d April on the heel n&#34;, &#39; Of limping Winter treads, even such delight n&#39;, &#39; Among fresh female buds shall you this night n&#39;, &#39; Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, n&#39;, &#39; And like her most whose merit most shall be; n&#39;, &#39; Which, on more view of many, mine, being one, n&#39;, &#34; May stand in number, though in reck&#39;ning none. n&#34;, &#39; Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go, n&#39;, &#39; sirrah, trudge about n&#39;, &#39; Through fair Verona; find those persons out n&#39;, &#39; Whose names are written there, and to them say, n&#39;, &#39; My house and welcome on their pleasure stay- n&#39;, &#39; Exeunt [Capulet and Paris]. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written n&#39;, &#39; that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor n&#39;, &#39; with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter n&#39;, &#39; with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are n&#39;, &#39; here writ, and can never find what names the writing person n&#39;, &#39; hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Benvolio and Romeo. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another&#39;s burning; n&#34;, &#34; One pain is lessoned by another&#39;s anguish; n&#34;, &#39; Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; n&#39;, &#34; One desperate grief cures with another&#39;s languish. n&#34;, &#39; Take thou some new infection to thy eye, n&#39;, &#39; And the rank poison of the old will die. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. For what, I pray thee? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. For your broken shin. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; n&#39;, &#39; Shut up in Prison, kept without my food, n&#39;, &#34; Whipp&#39;d and tormented and- God-den, good fellow. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Serv. God gi&#39; go-den. I pray, sir, can you read? n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can n&#39;, &#39; you read anything you see? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; &#39;Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; n&#34;, &#39; County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; n&#39;, &#39; The lady widow of Vitruvio; n&#39;, &#39; Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces; n&#39;, &#39; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; n&#39;, &#39; Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; n&#39;, &#39; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia; n&#39;, &#39; Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt; n&#39;, &#34; Lucio and the lively Helena.&#39; n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they n&#39;, &#39; come? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Serv. Up. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Whither? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Serv. To supper, to our house. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Whose house? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Serv. My master&#39;s. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Rom. Indeed I should have ask&#39;d you that before. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Serv. Now I&#39;ll tell you without asking. My master is the great n&#34;, &#39; rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray n&#39;, &#39; come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! Exit. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet&#39;s n&#34;, &#34; Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov&#39;st; n&#34;, &#39; With all the admired beauties of Verona. n&#39;, &#39; Go thither, and with unattainted eye n&#39;, &#39; Compare her face with some that I shall show, n&#39;, &#39; And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye n&#39;, &#39; Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; n&#39;, &#34; And these, who, often drown&#39;d, could never die, n&#34;, &#39; Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! n&#39;, &#39; One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun n&#39;, &#34; Ne&#39;er saw her match since first the world begun. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by, n&#39;, &#34; Herself pois&#39;d with herself in either eye; n&#34;, &#34; But in that crystal scales let there be weigh&#39;d n&#34;, &#34; Your lady&#39;s love against some other maid n&#34;, &#39; That I will show you shining at this feast, n&#39;, &#39; And she shall scant show well that now seems best. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Rom. I&#39;ll go along, no such sight to be shown, n&#34;, &#39; But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.] n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39;Scene III. n&#39;, &#34;Capulet&#39;s house. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34;Enter Capulet&#39;s Wife, and Nurse. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Wife. Nurse, where&#39;s my daughter? Call her forth to me. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old, n&#39;, &#39; I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird! n&#39;, &#34; God forbid! Where&#39;s this girl? What, Juliet! n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Juliet. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Jul. How now? Who calls? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. Your mother. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Jul. Madam, I am here. n&#39;, &#39; What is your will? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile, n&#39;, &#39; We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; n&#39;, &#34; I have rememb&#39;red me, thou&#39;s hear our counsel. n&#34;, &#34; Thou knowest my daughter&#39;s of a pretty age. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Wife. She&#39;s not fourteen. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Nurse. I&#39;ll lay fourteen of my teeth- n&#34;, &#39; And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four- n&#39;, &#39; She is not fourteen. How long is it now n&#39;, &#39; To Lammastide? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Wife. A fortnight and odd days. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, n&#39;, &#39; Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. n&#39;, &#39; Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!) n&#39;, &#39; Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; n&#39;, &#39; She was too good for me. But, as I said, n&#39;, &#39; On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen; n&#39;, &#39; That shall she, marry; I remember it well. n&#39;, &#34; &#39;Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; n&#34;, &#34; And she was wean&#39;d (I never shall forget it), n&#34;, &#39; Of all the days of the year, upon that day; n&#39;, &#39; For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, n&#39;, &#39; Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall. n&#39;, &#39; My lord and you were then at Mantua. n&#39;, &#39; Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said, n&#39;, &#39; When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple n&#39;, &#39; Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, n&#39;, &#39; To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! n&#39;, &#34; Shake, quoth the dovehouse! &#39;Twas no need, I trow, n&#34;, &#39; To bid me trudge. n&#39;, &#39; And since that time it is eleven years, n&#39;, &#34; For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th&#39; rood, n&#34;, &#39; She could have run and waddled all about; n&#39;, &#39; For even the day before, she broke her brow; n&#39;, &#39; And then my husband (God be with his soul! n&#39;, &#34; &#39;A was a merry man) took up the child. n&#34;, &#34; &#39;Yea,&#39; quoth he, &#39;dost thou fall upon thy face? n&#34;, &#39; Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; n&#39;, &#34; Wilt thou not, Jule?&#39; and, by my holidam, n&#34;, &#34; The pretty wretch left crying, and said &#39;Ay.&#39; n&#34;, &#39; To see now how a jest shall come about! n&#39;, &#39; I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas, n&#39;, &#34; I never should forget it. &#39;Wilt thou not, Jule?&#39; quoth he, n&#34;, &#34; And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said &#39;Ay.&#39; n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh n&#39;, &#34; To think it should leave crying and say &#39;Ay.&#39; n&#34;, &#39; And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow n&#39;, &#34; A bump as big as a young cock&#39;rel&#39;s stone; n&#34;, &#39; A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly. n&#39;, &#34; &#39;Yea,&#39; quoth my husband, &#39;fall&#39;st upon thy face? n&#34;, &#39; Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; n&#39;, &#34; Wilt thou not, Jule?&#39; It stinted, and said &#39;Ay.&#39; n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! n&#39;, &#34; Thou wast the prettiest babe that e&#39;er I nurs&#39;d. n&#34;, &#39; An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Wife. Marry, that &#39;marry&#39; is the very theme n&#34;, &#39; I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, n&#39;, &#39; How stands your disposition to be married? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse, n&#39;, &#34; I would say thou hadst suck&#39;d wisdom from thy teat. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you, n&#39;, &#39; Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, n&#39;, &#39; Are made already mothers. By my count, n&#39;, &#39; I was your mother much upon these years n&#39;, &#39; That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: n&#39;, &#39; The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man n&#39;, &#34; As all the world- why he&#39;s a man of wax. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Wife. Verona&#39;s summer hath not such a flower. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Nurse. Nay, he&#39;s a flower, in faith- a very flower. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman? n&#39;, &#39; This night you shall behold him at our feast. n&#39;, &#34; Read o&#39;er the volume of young Paris&#39; face, n&#34;, &#34; And find delight writ there with beauty&#39;s pen; n&#34;, &#39; Examine every married lineament, n&#39;, &#39; And see how one another lends content; n&#39;, &#34; And what obscur&#39;d in this fair volume lies n&#34;, &#39; Find written in the margent of his eyes, n&#39;, &#39; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, n&#39;, &#39; To beautify him only lacks a cover. n&#39;, &#34; The fish lives in the sea, and &#39;tis much pride n&#34;, &#39; For fair without the fair within to hide. n&#39;, &#34; That book in many&#39;s eyes doth share the glory, n&#34;, &#39; That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; n&#39;, &#39; So shall you share all that he doth possess, n&#39;, &#39; By having him making yourself no less. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris&#39; love? n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Jul. I&#39;ll look to like, if looking liking move; n&#34;, &#39; But no more deep will I endart mine eye n&#39;, &#39; Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Enter Servingman. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv&#39;d up, you call&#39;d, n&#34;, &#34; my young lady ask&#39;d for, the nurse curs&#39;d in the pantry, and n&#34;, &#39; everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you n&#39;, &#39; follow straight. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Wife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman]. n&#39;, &#39; Juliet, the County stays. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. n&#39;, &#39; Exeunt. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39;Scene IV. n&#39;, &#39;A street. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39;Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; n&#39;, &#39;Torchbearers. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? n&#39;, &#39; Or shall we on without apology? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. The date is out of such prolixity. n&#39;, &#34; We&#39;ll have no Cupid hoodwink&#39;d with a scarf, n&#34;, &#34; Bearing a Tartar&#39;s painted bow of lath, n&#34;, &#39; Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper; n&#39;, &#39; Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke n&#39;, &#39; After the prompter, for our entrance; n&#39;, &#39; But, let them measure us by what they will, n&#39;, &#34; We&#39;ll measure them a measure, and be gone. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling. n&#39;, &#39; Being but heavy, I will bear the light. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes n&#39;, &#39; With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead n&#39;, &#39; So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid&#39;s wings n&#34;, &#39; And soar with them above a common bound. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft n&#39;, &#39; To soar with his light feathers; and so bound n&#39;, &#39; I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. n&#39;, &#34; Under love&#39;s heavy burthen do I sink. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love- n&#39;, &#39; Too great oppression for a tender thing. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, n&#39;, &#34; Too rude, too boist&#39;rous, and it pricks like thorn. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love. n&#39;, &#39; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. n&#39;, &#39; Give me a case to put my visage in. n&#39;, &#39; A visor for a visor! What care I n&#39;, &#39; What curious eye doth quote deformities? n&#39;, &#39; Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in n&#39;, &#39; But every man betake him to his legs. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart n&#39;, &#39; Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; n&#39;, &#34; For I am proverb&#39;d with a grandsire phrase, n&#34;, &#34; I&#39;ll be a candle-holder and look on; n&#34;, &#34; The game was ne&#39;er so fair, and I am done. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Mer. Tut! dun&#39;s the mouse, the constable&#39;s own word! n&#34;, &#34; If thou art Dun, we&#39;ll draw thee from the mire n&#34;, &#34; Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick&#39;st n&#34;, &#39; Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#34; Rom. Nay, that&#39;s not so. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. I mean, sir, in delay n&#39;, &#39; We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. n&#39;, &#39; Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits n&#39;, &#39; Five times in that ere once in our five wits. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque; n&#39;, &#34; But &#39;tis no wit to go. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. Why, may one ask? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. And so did I. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Well, what was yours? n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. That dreamers often lie. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. n&#39;, &#34; She is the fairies&#39; midwife, and she comes n&#34;, &#39; In shape no bigger than an agate stone n&#39;, &#39; On the forefinger of an alderman, n&#39;, &#39; Drawn with a team of little atomies n&#39;, &#34; Athwart men&#39;s noses as they lie asleep; n&#34;, &#34; Her wagon spokes made of long spinners&#39; legs, n&#34;, &#39; The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; n&#39;, &#34; Her traces, of the smallest spider&#39;s web; n&#34;, &#34; Her collars, of the moonshine&#39;s wat&#39;ry beams; n&#34;, &#34; Her whip, of cricket&#39;s bone; the lash, of film; n&#34;, &#39; Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, n&#39;, &#39; Not half so big as a round little worm n&#39;, &#34; Prick&#39;d from the lazy finger of a maid; n&#34;, &#39; Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, n&#39;, &#39; Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, n&#39;, &#34; Time out o&#39; mind the fairies&#39; coachmakers. n&#34;, &#34; And in this state she &#39;gallops night by night n&#34;, &#34; Through lovers&#39; brains, and then they dream of love; n&#34;, &#34; O&#39;er courtiers&#39; knees, that dream on cursies straight; n&#34;, &#34; O&#39;er lawyers&#39; fingers, who straight dream on fees; n&#34;, &#34; O&#39;er ladies&#39; lips, who straight on kisses dream, n&#34;, &#39; Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, n&#39;, &#39; Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. n&#39;, &#34; Sometime she gallops o&#39;er a courtier&#39;s nose, n&#34;, &#39; And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; n&#39;, &#34; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig&#39;s tail n&#34;, &#34; Tickling a parson&#39;s nose as &#39;a lies asleep, n&#34;, &#39; Then dreams he of another benefice. n&#39;, &#34; Sometimes she driveth o&#39;er a soldier&#39;s neck, n&#34;, &#39; And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, n&#39;, &#39; Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, n&#39;, &#39; Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon n&#39;, &#39; Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, n&#39;, &#39; And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two n&#39;, &#39; And sleeps again. This is that very Mab n&#39;, &#39; That plats the manes of horses in the night n&#39;, &#39; And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs, n&#39;, &#39; Which once untangled much misfortune bodes n&#39;, &#39; This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, n&#39;, &#39; That presses them and learns them first to bear, n&#39;, &#39; Making them women of good carriage. n&#39;, &#39; This is she- n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! n&#39;, &#34; Thou talk&#39;st of nothing. n&#34;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Mer. True, I talk of dreams; n&#39;, &#39; Which are the children of an idle brain, n&#39;, &#39; Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; n&#39;, &#39; Which is as thin of substance as the air, n&#39;, &#39; And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes n&#39;, &#39; Even now the frozen bosom of the North n&#39;, &#34; And, being anger&#39;d, puffs away from thence, n&#34;, &#39; Turning his face to the dew-dropping South. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves. n&#39;, &#39; Supper is done, and we shall come too late. n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives n&#39;, &#39; Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, n&#39;, &#39; Shall bitterly begin his fearful date n&#39;, &#34; With this night&#39;s revels and expire the term n&#34;, &#34; Of a despised life, clos&#39;d in my breast, n&#34;, &#39; By some vile forfeit of untimely death. n&#39;, &#39; But he that hath the steerage of my course n&#39;, &#39; Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen! n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, &#39; Ben. Strike, drum. n&#39;, &#39; They march about the stage.

Two households, both alike in dignity, n In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, n From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, n Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. n From forth the fatal loins of these two foes n A pair of star-cross &#39;d lovers take their life; n Whose misadventur &#39;d piteous overthrows n Doth with their death bury their parents &#39; strife. n The fearful passage of their death-mark &#39;d love, n And the continuance of their parents &#39; rage, n Which, but their children &#39;s end, naught could remove, n Is now the two hours &#39; traffic of our stage; n The which if you with patient ears attend, n What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. n [Exit.] n n n n n ACT I. Scene I. n Verona. A public place. n n Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house n of Capulet. n n n Samp. Gregory, on my word, we &#39;ll not carry coals. n n Greg. No, for then we should be colliers. n n Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we &#39;ll draw. n n Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar. n n Samp. I strike quickly, being moved. n n Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. n n Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. n n Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand. n Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn &#39;st away. n n Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take n the wall of any man or maid of Montague &#39;s. n n Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the n wall. n n Samp. &#39;Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, n are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague &#39;s men n from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall. n n Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. n n Samp. &#39;Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have n fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off n their heads. n n Greg. The heads of the maids? n n Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads. n Take it in what sense thou wilt. n n Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it. n n Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and &#39;tis known I n am a pretty piece of flesh. n n Greg. &#39;Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst n been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of n Montagues. n n Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar]. n n n Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee. n n Greg. How? turn thy back and run? n n Samp. Fear me not. n n Greg. No, marry. I fear thee! n n Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. n n Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. n n Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is n disgrace to them, if they bear it. n n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? n n Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir. n n Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? n n Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay? n n Greg. [aside to Sampson] No. n n Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my n thumb, sir. n n Greg. Do you quarrel, sir? n n Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir. n n Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as n you. n n Abr. No better. n n Samp. Well, sir. n n Enter Benvolio. n n n Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say &#39;better. &#39; Here comes one of my n master &#39;s kinsmen. n n Samp. Yes, better, sir. n n Abr. You lie. n n Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. n They fight. n n Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.] n Put up your swords. You know not what you do. n n Enter Tybalt. n n n Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? n Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death. n n Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword, n Or manage it to part these men with me. n n Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word n As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee. n Have at thee, coward! They fight. n n Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or n partisans. n n n Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down! n n Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues! n n Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife. n n n Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! n n Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword? n n Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come n And flourishes his blade in spite of me. n n Enter Old Montague and his Wife. n n n Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go. n n M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe. n n Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train. n n n Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, n Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel- n Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, n That quench the fire of your pernicious rage n With purple fountains issuing from your veins! n On pain of torture, from those bloody hands n Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground n And hear the sentence of your moved prince. n Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word n By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, n Have thrice disturb &#39;d the quiet of our streets n And made Verona &#39;s ancient citizens n Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments n To wield old partisans, in hands as old, n Cank &#39;red with peace, to part your cank &#39;red hate. n If ever you disturb our streets again, n Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. n For this time all the rest depart away. n You, Capulet, shall go along with me; n And, Montague, come you this afternoon, n To know our farther pleasure in this case, n To old Freetown, our common judgment place. n Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. n Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio]. n n Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? n Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? n n Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary n And yours, close fighting ere I did approach. n I drew to part them. In the instant came n The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar &#39;d; n Which, as he breath &#39;d defiance to my ears, n He swung about his head and cut the winds, n Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss &#39;d him in scorn. n While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, n Came more and more, and fought on part and part, n Till the Prince came, who parted either part. n n M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day? n Right glad I am he was not at this fray. n n Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp &#39;d sun n Peer &#39;d forth the golden window of the East, n A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; n Where, underneath the grove of sycamore n That westward rooteth from the city &#39;s side, n So early walking did I see your son. n Towards him I made; but he was ware of me n And stole into the covert of the wood. n I- measuring his affections by my own, n Which then most sought where most might not be found, n Being one too many by my weary self- n Pursu &#39;d my humour, not Pursuing his, n And gladly shunn &#39;d who gladly fled from me. n n Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen, n With tears augmenting the fresh morning &#39;s dew, n Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; n But all so soon as the all-cheering sun n Should in the furthest East bean to draw n The shady curtains from Aurora &#39;s bed, n Away from light steals home my heavy son n And private in his chamber pens himself, n Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight n And makes himself an artificial night. n Black and portentous must this humour prove n Unless good counsel may the cause remove. n n Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? n n Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him n n Ben. Have you importun &#39;d him by any means? n n Mon. Both by myself and many other friend; n But he, his own affections &#39; counsellor, n Is to himself- I will not say how true- n But to himself so secret and so close, n So far from sounding and discovery, n As is the bud bit with an envious worm n Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air n Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. n Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, n We would as willingly give cure as know. n n Enter Romeo. n n n Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside, n I &#39;ll know his grievance, or be much denied. n n Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay n To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let &#39;s away, n Exeunt [Montague and Wife]. n n Ben. Good morrow, cousin. n n Rom. Is the day so young? n n Ben. But new struck nine. n n Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long. n Was that my father that went hence so fast? n n Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo &#39;s hours? n n Rom. Not having that which having makes them short. n n Ben. In love? n n Rom. Out- n n Ben. Of love? n n Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love. n n Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view, n Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! n n Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still, n Should without eyes see pathways to his will! n Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? n Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. n Here &#39;s much to do with hate, but more with love. n Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! n O anything, of nothing first create! n O heavy lightness! serious vanity! n Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! n Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! n Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is n This love feel I, that feel no love in this. n Dost thou not laugh? n n Ben. No, coz, I rather weep. n n Rom. Good heart, at what? n n Ben. At thy good heart &#39;s oppression. n n Rom. Why, such is love &#39;s transgression. n Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, n Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest n With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown n Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. n Love is a smoke rais &#39;d with the fume of sighs; n Being purg &#39;d, a fire sparkling in lovers &#39; eyes; n Being vex &#39;d, a sea nourish &#39;d with lovers &#39; tears. n What is it else? A madness most discreet, n A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. n Farewell, my coz. n n Ben. Soft! I will go along. n An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. n n Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here: n This is not Romeo, he &#39;s some other where. n n Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love? n n Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee? n n Ben. Groan? Why, no; n But sadly tell me who. n n Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will. n Ah, word ill urg &#39;d to one that is so ill! n In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. n n Ben. I aim &#39;d so near when I suppos &#39;d you lov &#39;d. n n Rom. A right good markman! And she &#39;s fair I love. n n Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. n n Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She &#39;ll not be hit n With Cupid &#39;s arrow. She hath Dian &#39;s wit, n And, in strong proof of chastity well arm &#39;d, n From Love &#39;s weak childish bow she lives unharm &#39;d. n She will not stay the siege of loving terms, n Nor bide th &#39; encounter of assailing eyes, n Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. n O, she &#39;s rich in beauty; only poor n That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store. n n Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? n n Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; n For beauty, starv &#39;d with her severity, n Cuts beauty off from all posterity. n She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, n To merit bliss by making me despair. n She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow n Do I live dead that live to tell it now. n n Ben. Be rul &#39;d by me: forget to think of her. n n Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think! n n Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes. n Examine other beauties. n n Rom. &#39;Tis the way n To call hers (exquisite) in question more. n These happy masks that kiss fair ladies &#39; brows, n Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair. n He that is strucken blind cannot forget n The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. n Show me a mistress that is passing fair, n What doth her beauty serve but as a note n Where I may read who pass &#39;d that passing fair? n Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. n n Ben. I &#39;ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt. n n n n n Scene II. n A Street. n n Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown. n n n Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I, n In penalty alike; and &#39;tis not hard, I think, n For men so old as we to keep the peace. n n Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both, n And pity &#39;tis you liv &#39;d at odds so long. n But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? n n Cap. But saying o &#39;er what I have said before: n My child is yet a stranger in the world, n She hath not seen the change of fourteen years; n Let two more summers wither in their pride n Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. n n Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made. n n Cap. And too soon marr &#39;d are those so early made. n The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; n She is the hopeful lady of my earth. n But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart; n My will to her consent is but a part. n An she agree, within her scope of choice n Lies my consent and fair according voice. n This night I hold an old accustom &#39;d feast, n Whereto I have invited many a guest, n Such as I love; and you among the store, n One more, most welcome, makes my number more. n At my poor house look to behold this night n Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light. n Such comfort as do lusty young men feel n When well apparell &#39;d April on the heel n Of limping Winter treads, even such delight n Among fresh female buds shall you this night n Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see, n And like her most whose merit most shall be; n Which, on more view of many, mine, being one, n May stand in number, though in reck &#39;ning none. n Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go, n sirrah, trudge about n Through fair Verona; find those persons out n Whose names are written there, and to them say, n My house and welcome on their pleasure stay- n Exeunt [Capulet and Paris]. n n Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written n that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor n with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter n with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are n here writ, and can never find what names the writing person n hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time! n n Enter Benvolio and Romeo. n n n Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another &#39;s burning; n One pain is lessoned by another &#39;s anguish; n Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; n One desperate grief cures with another &#39;s languish. n Take thou some new infection to thy eye, n And the rank poison of the old will die. n n Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that. n n Ben. For what, I pray thee? n n Rom. For your broken shin. n n Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? n n Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; n Shut up in Prison, kept without my food, n Whipp &#39;d and tormented and- God-den, good fellow. n n Serv. God gi &#39; go-den. I pray, sir, can you read? n n Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. n n Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can n you read anything you see? n n Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language. n n Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry! n n Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads. n n &#39;Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; n County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; n The lady widow of Vitruvio; n Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces; n Mercutio and his brother Valentine; n Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; n My fair niece Rosaline and Livia; n Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt; n Lucio and the lively Helena. &#39; n n [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they n come? n n Serv. Up. n n Rom. Whither? n n Serv. To supper, to our house. n n Rom. Whose house? n n Serv. My master &#39;s. n n Rom. Indeed I should have ask &#39;d you that before. n n Serv. Now I &#39;ll tell you without asking. My master is the great n rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray n come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! Exit. n n Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet &#39;s n Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov &#39;st; n With all the admired beauties of Verona. n Go thither, and with unattainted eye n Compare her face with some that I shall show, n And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. n n Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye n Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; n And these, who, often drown &#39;d, could never die, n Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! n One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun n Ne &#39;er saw her match since first the world begun. n n Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by, n Herself pois &#39;d with herself in either eye; n But in that crystal scales let there be weigh &#39;d n Your lady &#39;s love against some other maid n That I will show you shining at this feast, n And she shall scant show well that now seems best. n n Rom. I &#39;ll go along, no such sight to be shown, n But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.] n n n n n Scene III. n Capulet &#39;s house. n n Enter Capulet &#39;s Wife, and Nurse. n n n Wife. Nurse, where &#39;s my daughter? Call her forth to me. n n Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old, n I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird! n God forbid! Where &#39;s this girl? What, Juliet! n n Enter Juliet. n n n Jul. How now? Who calls? n n Nurse. Your mother. n n Jul. Madam, I am here. n What is your will? n n Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile, n We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; n I have rememb &#39;red me, thou &#39;s hear our counsel. n Thou knowest my daughter &#39;s of a pretty age. n n Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. n n Wife. She &#39;s not fourteen. n n Nurse. I &#39;ll lay fourteen of my teeth- n And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four- n She is not fourteen. How long is it now n To Lammastide? n n Wife. A fortnight and odd days. n n Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, n Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. n Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!) n Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God; n She was too good for me. But, as I said, n On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen; n That shall she, marry; I remember it well. n &#39;Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; n And she was wean &#39;d (I never shall forget it), n Of all the days of the year, upon that day; n For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, n Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall. n My lord and you were then at Mantua. n Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said, n When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple n Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, n To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! n Shake, quoth the dovehouse! &#39;Twas no need, I trow, n To bid me trudge. n And since that time it is eleven years, n For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th &#39; rood, n She could have run and waddled all about; n For even the day before, she broke her brow; n And then my husband (God be with his soul! n &#39;A was a merry man) took up the child. n &#39;Yea, &#39; quoth he, &#39;dost thou fall upon thy face? n Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; n Wilt thou not, Jule? &#39; and, by my holidam, n The pretty wretch left crying, and said &#39;Ay. &#39; n To see now how a jest shall come about! n I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas, n I never should forget it. &#39;Wilt thou not, Jule? &#39; quoth he, n And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said &#39;Ay. &#39; n n Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace. n n Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh n To think it should leave crying and say &#39;Ay. &#39; n And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow n A bump as big as a young cock &#39;rel &#39;s stone; n A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly. n &#39;Yea, &#39; quoth my husband, &#39;fall &#39;st upon thy face? n Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; n Wilt thou not, Jule? &#39; It stinted, and said &#39;Ay. &#39; n n Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. n n Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! n Thou wast the prettiest babe that e &#39;er I nurs &#39;d. n An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish. n n Wife. Marry, that &#39;marry &#39; is the very theme n I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, n How stands your disposition to be married? n n Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of. n n Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse, n I would say thou hadst suck &#39;d wisdom from thy teat. n n Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you, n Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, n Are made already mothers. By my count, n I was your mother much upon these years n That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: n The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. n n Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man n As all the world- why he &#39;s a man of wax. n n Wife. Verona &#39;s summer hath not such a flower. n n Nurse. Nay, he &#39;s a flower, in faith- a very flower. n n Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman? n This night you shall behold him at our feast. n Read o &#39;er the volume of young Paris &#39; face, n And find delight writ there with beauty &#39;s pen; n Examine every married lineament, n And see how one another lends content; n And what obscur &#39;d in this fair volume lies n Find written in the margent of his eyes, n This precious book of love, this unbound lover, n To beautify him only lacks a cover. n The fish lives in the sea, and &#39;tis much pride n For fair without the fair within to hide. n That book in many &#39;s eyes doth share the glory, n That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; n So shall you share all that he doth possess, n By having him making yourself no less. n n Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men n n Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris &#39; love? n n Jul. I &#39;ll look to like, if looking liking move; n But no more deep will I endart mine eye n Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. n n Enter Servingman. n n n Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv &#39;d up, you call &#39;d, n my young lady ask &#39;d for, the nurse curs &#39;d in the pantry, and n everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you n follow straight. n n Wife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman]. n Juliet, the County stays. n n Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene IV. n A street. n n Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; n Torchbearers. n n n Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? n Or shall we on without apology? n n Ben. The date is out of such prolixity. n We &#39;ll have no Cupid hoodwink &#39;d with a scarf, n Bearing a Tartar &#39;s painted bow of lath, n Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper; n Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke n After the prompter, for our entrance; n But, let them measure us by what they will, n We &#39;ll measure them a measure, and be gone. n n Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling. n Being but heavy, I will bear the light. n n Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. n n Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes n With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead n So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. n n Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid &#39;s wings n And soar with them above a common bound. n n Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft n To soar with his light feathers; and so bound n I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. n Under love &#39;s heavy burthen do I sink. n n Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love- n Too great oppression for a tender thing. n n Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, n Too rude, too boist &#39;rous, and it pricks like thorn. n n Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love. n Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. n Give me a case to put my visage in. n A visor for a visor! What care I n What curious eye doth quote deformities? n Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. n n Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in n But every man betake him to his legs. n n Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart n Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; n For I am proverb &#39;d with a grandsire phrase, n I &#39;ll be a candle-holder and look on; n The game was ne &#39;er so fair, and I am done. n n Mer. Tut! dun &#39;s the mouse, the constable &#39;s own word! n If thou art Dun, we &#39;ll draw thee from the mire n Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick &#39;st n Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! n n Rom. Nay, that &#39;s not so. n n Mer. I mean, sir, in delay n We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. n Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits n Five times in that ere once in our five wits. n n Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque; n But &#39;tis no wit to go. n n Mer. Why, may one ask? n n Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night. n n Mer. And so did I. n n Rom. Well, what was yours? n n Mer. That dreamers often lie. n n Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. n n Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. n She is the fairies &#39; midwife, and she comes n In shape no bigger than an agate stone n On the forefinger of an alderman, n Drawn with a team of little atomies n Athwart men &#39;s noses as they lie asleep; n Her wagon spokes made of long spinners &#39; legs, n The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; n Her traces, of the smallest spider &#39;s web; n Her collars, of the moonshine &#39;s wat &#39;ry beams; n Her whip, of cricket &#39;s bone; the lash, of film; n Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, n Not half so big as a round little worm n Prick &#39;d from the lazy finger of a maid; n Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, n Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, n Time out o &#39; mind the fairies &#39; coachmakers. n And in this state she &#39;gallops night by night n Through lovers &#39; brains, and then they dream of love; n O &#39;er courtiers &#39; knees, that dream on cursies straight; n O &#39;er lawyers &#39; fingers, who straight dream on fees; n O &#39;er ladies &#39; lips, who straight on kisses dream, n Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, n Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. n Sometime she gallops o &#39;er a courtier &#39;s nose, n And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; n And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig &#39;s tail n Tickling a parson &#39;s nose as &#39;a lies asleep, n Then dreams he of another benefice. n Sometimes she driveth o &#39;er a soldier &#39;s neck, n And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, n Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, n Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon n Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, n And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two n And sleeps again. This is that very Mab n That plats the manes of horses in the night n And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs, n Which once untangled much misfortune bodes n This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, n That presses them and learns them first to bear, n Making them women of good carriage. n This is she- n n Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! n Thou talk &#39;st of nothing. n n Mer. True, I talk of dreams; n Which are the children of an idle brain, n Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; n Which is as thin of substance as the air, n And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes n Even now the frozen bosom of the North n And, being anger &#39;d, puffs away from thence, n Turning his face to the dew-dropping South. n n Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves. n Supper is done, and we shall come too late. n n Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives n Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, n Shall bitterly begin his fearful date n With this night &#39;s revels and expire the term n Of a despised life, clos &#39;d in my breast, n By some vile forfeit of untimely death. n But he that hath the steerage of my course n Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen! n n Ben. Strike, drum. n They march about the stage. [Exeunt.] n n n n n Scene V. n Capulet &#39;s house. n n Servingmen come forth with napkins. n n 1. Serv. Where &#39;s Potpan, that he helps not to take away? n He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher! n 2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men &#39;s n hands, and they unwash &#39;d too, &#39;tis a foul thing. n 1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert, n look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as n thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and n Nell. n Anthony, and Potpan! n 2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready. n 1. Serv. You are look &#39;d for and call &#39;d for, ask &#39;d for and n sought for, in the great chamber. n 3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys! n Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. Exeunt. n n Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife, n Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests n and Gentlewomen to the Maskers. n n n Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes n Unplagu &#39;d with corns will have a bout with you. n Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all n Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty, n She I &#39;ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now? n Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day n That I have worn a visor and could tell n A whispering tale in a fair lady &#39;s ear, n Such as would please. &#39;Tis gone, &#39;tis gone, &#39;tis gone! n You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play. n A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls. n Music plays, and they dance. n More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up, n And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. n Ah, sirrah, this unlook &#39;d-for sport comes well. n Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet, n For you and I are past our dancing days. n How long is &#39;t now since last yourself and I n Were in a mask? n 2. Cap. By &#39;r Lady, thirty years. n n Cap. What, man? &#39;Tis not so much, &#39;tis not so much! n &#39;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, n Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, n Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask &#39;d. n 2. Cap. &#39;Tis more, &#39;tis more! His son is elder, sir; n His son is thirty. n n Cap. Will you tell me that? n His son was but a ward two years ago. n n Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady &#39;s that, which doth enrich the n hand Of yonder knight? n n Serv. I know not, sir. n n Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! n It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night n Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop &#39;s ear- n Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! n So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows n As yonder lady o &#39;er her fellows shows. n The measure done, I &#39;ll watch her place of stand n And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. n Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! n For I ne &#39;er saw true beauty till this night. n n Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague. n Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave n Come hither, cover &#39;d with an antic face, n To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? n Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, n To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. n n Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so? n n Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe; n A villain, that is hither come in spite n To scorn at our solemnity this night. n n Cap. Young Romeo is it? n n Tyb. &#39;Tis he, that villain Romeo. n n Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone. n &#39;A bears him like a portly gentleman, n And, to say truth, Verona brags of him n To be a virtuous and well-govern &#39;d youth. n I would not for the wealth of all this town n Here in my house do him disparagement. n Therefore be patient, take no note of him. n It is my will; the which if thou respect, n Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, n An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. n n Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest. n I &#39;ll not endure him. n n Cap. He shall be endur &#39;d. n What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to! n Am I the master here, or you? Go to! n You &#39;ll not endure him? God shall mend my soul! n You &#39;ll make a mutiny among my guests! n You will set cock-a-hoop! you &#39;ll be the man! n n Tyb. Why, uncle, &#39;tis a shame. n n Cap. Go to, go to! n You are a saucy boy. Is &#39;t so, indeed? n This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what. n You must contrary me! Marry, &#39;tis time.- n Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go! n Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame! n I &#39;ll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts! n n Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting n Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. n I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall, n Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt &#39;rest gall. Exit. n n Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand n This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: n My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand n To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. n n Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, n Which mannerly devotion shows in this; n For saints have hands that pilgrims &#39; hands do touch, n And palm to palm is holy palmers &#39; kiss. n n Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? n n Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray &#39;r. n n Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do! n They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. n n Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers &#39; sake. n n Rom. Then move not while my prayer &#39;s effect I take. n Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg &#39;d. [Kisses her.] n n Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. n n Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg &#39;d! n Give me my sin again. [Kisses her.] n n Jul. You kiss by th &#39; book. n n Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you. n n Rom. What is her mother? n n Nurse. Marry, bachelor, n Her mother is the lady of the house. n And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous. n I nurs &#39;d her daughter that you talk &#39;d withal. n I tell you, he that can lay hold of her n Shall have the chinks. n n Rom. Is she a Capulet? n O dear account! my life is my foe &#39;s debt. n n Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best. n n Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. n n Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; n We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. n Is it e &#39;en so? Why then, I thank you all. n I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night. n More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let &#39;s to bed. n Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late; n I &#39;ll to my rest. n Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse]. n n Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? n n Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio. n n Jul. What &#39;s he that now is going out of door? n n Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio. n n Jul. What &#39;s he that follows there, that would not dance? n n Nurse. I know not. n n Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married, n My grave is like to be my wedding bed. n n Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague, n The only son of your great enemy. n n Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate! n Too early seen unknown, and known too late! n Prodigious birth of love it is to me n That I must love a loathed enemy. n n Nurse. What &#39;s this? what &#39;s this? n n Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now n Of one I danc &#39;d withal. n One calls within, &#39;Juliet. &#39; n n Nurse. Anon, anon! n Come, let &#39;s away; the strangers all are gone. Exeunt. n n n n n PROLOGUE n n Enter Chorus. n n n Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, n And young affection gapes to be his heir; n That fair for which love groan &#39;d for and would die, n With tender Juliet match &#39;d, is now not fair. n Now Romeo is belov &#39;d, and loves again, n Alike bewitched by the charm of looks; n But to his foe suppos &#39;d he must complain, n And she steal love &#39;s sweet bait from fearful hooks. n Being held a foe, he may not have access n To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear, n And she as much in love, her means much less n To meet her new beloved anywhere; n But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, n Temp &#39;ring extremities with extreme sweet. n Exit. n n n n n ACT II. Scene I. n A lane by the wall of Capulet &#39;s orchard. n n Enter Romeo alone. n n n Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here? n Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. n [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.] n n Enter Benvolio with Mercutio. n n n Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo! n n Mer. He is wise, n And, on my life, hath stol &#39;n him home to bed. n n Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall. n Call, good Mercutio. n n Mer. Nay, I &#39;ll conjure too. n Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! n Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; n Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied! n Cry but &#39;Ay me! &#39; pronounce but &#39;love &#39; and &#39;dove &#39;; n Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, n One nickname for her purblind son and heir, n Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim n When King Cophetua lov &#39;d the beggar maid! n He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not; n The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. n I conjure thee by Rosaline &#39;s bright eyes. n By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, n By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh, n And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, n That in thy likeness thou appear to us! n n Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. n n Mer. This cannot anger him. &#39;Twould anger him n To raise a spirit in his mistress &#39; circle n Of some strange nature, letting it there stand n Till she had laid it and conjur &#39;d it down. n That were some spite; my invocation n Is fair and honest: in his mistress &#39; name, n I conjure only but to raise up him. n n Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees n To be consorted with the humorous night. n Blind is his love and best befits the dark. n n Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. n Now will he sit under a medlar tree n And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit n As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. n O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were n An open et cetera, thou a pop &#39;rin pear! n Romeo, good night. I &#39;ll to my truckle-bed; n This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep. n Come, shall we go? n n Ben. Go then, for &#39;tis in vain n &#39;To seek him here that means not to be found. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene II. n Capulet &#39;s orchard. n n Enter Romeo. n n n Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound. n n Enter Juliet above at a window. n n But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? n It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! n Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, n Who is already sick and pale with grief n That thou her maid art far more fair than she. n Be not her maid, since she is envious. n Her vestal livery is but sick and green, n And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off. n It is my lady; O, it is my love! n O that she knew she were! n She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that? n Her eye discourses; I will answer it. n I am too bold; &#39;tis not to me she speaks. n Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, n Having some business, do entreat her eyes n To twinkle in their spheres till they return. n What if her eyes were there, they in her head? n The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars n As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven n Would through the airy region stream so bright n That birds would sing and think it were not night. n See how she leans her cheek upon her hand! n O that I were a glove upon that hand, n That I might touch that cheek! n n Jul. Ay me! n n Rom. She speaks. n O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art n As glorious to this night, being o &#39;er my head, n As is a winged messenger of heaven n Unto the white-upturned wond &#39;ring eyes n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him n When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds n And sails upon the bosom of the air. n n Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? n Deny thy father and refuse thy name! n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, n And I &#39;ll no longer be a Capulet. n n Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? n n Jul. &#39;Tis but thy name that is my enemy. n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. n What &#39;s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, n Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part n Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! n What &#39;s in a name? That which we call a rose n By any other name would smell as sweet. n So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call &#39;d, n Retain that dear perfection which he owes n Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name; n And for that name, which is no part of thee, n Take all myself. n n Rom. I take thee at thy word. n Call me but love, and I &#39;ll be new baptiz &#39;d; n Henceforth I never will be Romeo. n n Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen &#39;d in night, n So stumblest on my counsel? n n Rom. By a name n I know not how to tell thee who I am. n My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, n Because it is an enemy to thee. n Had I it written, I would tear the word. n n Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words n Of that tongue &#39;s utterance, yet I know the sound. n Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? n n Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. n n Jul. How cam &#39;st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? n The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, n And the place death, considering who thou art, n If any of my kinsmen find thee here. n n Rom. With love &#39;s light wings did I o &#39;erperch these walls; n For stony limits cannot hold love out, n And what love can do, that dares love attempt. n Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. n n Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee. n n Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye n Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, n And I am proof against their enmity. n n Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here. n n Rom. I have night &#39;s cloak to hide me from their sight; n And but thou love me, let them find me here. n My life were better ended by their hate n Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. n n Jul. By whose direction found &#39;st thou out this place? n n Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire. n He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. n I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far n As that vast shore wash &#39;d with the farthest sea, n I would adventure for such merchandise. n n Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face; n Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek n For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night. n Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny n What I have spoke; but farewell compliment! n Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say &#39;Ay &#39;; n And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear &#39;st, n Thou mayst prove false. At lovers &#39; perjuries, n They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, n If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. n Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, n I &#39;ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, n So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. n In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, n And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light; n But trust me, gentleman, I &#39;ll prove more true n Than those that have more cunning to be strange. n I should have been more strange, I must confess, n But that thou overheard &#39;st, ere I was ware, n My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me, n And not impute this yielding to light love, n Which the dark night hath so discovered. n n Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, n That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops- n n Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th &#39; inconstant moon, n That monthly changes in her circled orb, n Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. n n Rom. What shall I swear by? n n Jul. Do not swear at all; n Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, n Which is the god of my idolatry, n And I &#39;ll believe thee. n n Rom. If my heart &#39;s dear love- n n Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, n I have no joy of this contract to-night. n It is too rash, too unadvis &#39;d, too sudden; n Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be n Ere one can say &#39;It lightens. &#39; Sweet, good night! n This bud of love, by summer &#39;s ripening breath, n May prove a beauteous flow &#39;r when next we meet. n Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest n Come to thy heart as that within my breast! n n Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? n n Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? n n Rom. Th &#39; exchange of thy love &#39;s faithful vow for mine. n n Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it; n And yet I would it were to give again. n n Rom. Would &#39;st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love? n n Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again. n And yet I wish but for the thing I have. n My bounty is as boundless as the sea, n My love as deep; the more I give to thee, n The more I have, for both are infinite. n I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu! n [Nurse] calls within. n Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. n Stay but a little, I will come again. [Exit.] n n Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard, n Being in night, all this is but a dream, n Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. n n Enter Juliet above. n n n Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. n If that thy bent of love be honourable, n Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, n By one that I &#39;ll procure to come to thee, n Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; n And all my fortunes at thy foot I &#39;ll lay n And follow thee my lord throughout the world. n n Nurse. (within) Madam! n n Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well, n I do beseech thee- n n Nurse. (within) Madam! n n Jul. By-and-by I come.- n To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief. n To-morrow will I send. n n Rom. So thrive my soul- n n Jul. A thousand times good night! Exit. n n Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! n Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; n But love from love, towards school with heavy looks. n n Enter Juliet again, [above]. n n n Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer &#39;s voice n To lure this tassel-gentle back again! n Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud; n Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, n And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine n With repetition of my Romeo &#39;s name. n Romeo! n n Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name. n How silver-sweet sound lovers &#39; tongues by night, n Like softest music to attending ears! n n Jul. Romeo! n n Rom. My dear? n n Jul. At what o &#39;clock to-morrow n Shall I send to thee? n n Rom. By the hour of nine. n n Jul. I will not fail. &#39;Tis twenty years till then. n I have forgot why I did call thee back. n n Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it. n n Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, n Rememb &#39;ring how I love thy company. n n Rom. And I &#39;ll still stay, to have thee still forget, n Forgetting any other home but this. n n Jul. &#39;Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone- n And yet no farther than a wanton &#39;s bird, n That lets it hop a little from her hand, n Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, n And with a silk thread plucks it back again, n So loving-jealous of his liberty. n n Rom. I would I were thy bird. n n Jul. Sweet, so would I. n Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. n Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, n That I shall say good night till it be morrow. n [Exit.] n n Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! n Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! n Hence will I to my ghostly father &#39;s cell, n His help to crave and my dear hap to tell. n Exit n n n n n Scene III. n Friar Laurence &#39;s cell. n n Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket. n n n Friar. The grey-ey &#39;d morn smiles on the frowning night, n Check &#39;ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light; n And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels n From forth day &#39;s path and Titan &#39;s fiery wheels. n Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye n The day to cheer and night &#39;s dank dew to dry, n I must up-fill this osier cage of ours n With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. n The earth that &#39;s nature &#39;s mother is her tomb. n What is her burying gave, that is her womb; n And from her womb children of divers kind n We sucking on her natural bosom find; n Many for many virtues excellent, n None but for some, and yet all different. n O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies n In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities; n For naught so vile that on the earth doth live n But to the earth some special good doth give; n Nor aught so good but, strain &#39;d from that fair use, n Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. n Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, n And vice sometime &#39;s by action dignified. n Within the infant rind of this small flower n Poison hath residence, and medicine power; n For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; n Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. n Two such opposed kings encamp them still n In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will; n And where the worser is predominant, n Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. n n Enter Romeo. n n n Rom. Good morrow, father. n n Friar. Benedicite! n What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? n Young son, it argues a distempered head n So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. n Care keeps his watch in every old man &#39;s eye, n And where care lodges sleep will never lie; n But where unbruised youth with unstuff &#39;d brain n Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign. n Therefore thy earliness doth me assure n Thou art uprous &#39;d with some distemp &#39;rature; n Or if not so, then here I hit it right- n Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. n n Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine. n n Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline? n n Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. n I have forgot that name, and that name &#39;s woe. n n Friar. That &#39;s my good son! But where hast thou been then? n n Rom. I &#39;ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again. n I have been feasting with mine enemy, n Where on a sudden one hath wounded me n That &#39;s by me wounded. Both our remedies n Within thy help and holy physic lies. n I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, n My intercession likewise steads my foe. n n Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift n Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. n n Rom. Then plainly know my heart &#39;s dear love is set n On the fair daughter of rich Capulet; n As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, n And all combin &#39;d, save what thou must combine n By holy marriage. When, and where, and how n We met, we woo &#39;d, and made exchange of vow, n I &#39;ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, n That thou consent to marry us to-day. n n Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here! n Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, n So soon forsaken? Young men &#39;s love then lies n Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. n Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine n Hath wash &#39;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! n How much salt water thrown away in waste, n To season love, that of it doth not taste! n The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, n Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears. n Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit n Of an old tear that is not wash &#39;d off yet. n If e &#39;er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, n Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline. n And art thou chang &#39;d? Pronounce this sentence then: n Women may fall when there &#39;s no strength in men. n n Rom. Thou chid &#39;st me oft for loving Rosaline. n n Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. n n Rom. And bad &#39;st me bury love. n n Friar. Not in a grave n To lay one in, another out to have. n n Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now n Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. n The other did not so. n n Friar. O, she knew well n Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. n But come, young waverer, come go with me. n In one respect I &#39;ll thy assistant be; n For this alliance may so happy prove n To turn your households &#39; rancour to pure love. n n Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste. n n Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene IV. n A street. n n Enter Benvolio and Mercutio. n n n Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be? n Came he not home to-night? n n Ben. Not to his father &#39;s. I spoke with his man. n n Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, n Torments him so that he will sure run mad. n n Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, n Hath sent a letter to his father &#39;s house. n n Mer. A challenge, on my life. n n Ben. Romeo will answer it. n n Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter. n n Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter &#39;s master, how he dares, n being dared. n n Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb &#39;d with a white n wench &#39;s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the n very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy &#39;s n butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt? n n Ben. Why, what is Tybalt? n n Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he &#39;s the n courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing n pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his n minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very n butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman n of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the n immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay. n n Ben. The what? n n Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- n these new tuners of accent! &#39;By Jesu, a very good blade! a very n tall man! a very good whore! &#39; Why, is not this a lamentable thing, n grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange n flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi &#39;s, who stand n so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old n bench? O, their bones, their bones! n n Enter Romeo. n n n Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo! n n Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how n art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch n flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she n had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy, n Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so, n but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There &#39;s a French n salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit n fairly last night. n n Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? n n Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive? n n Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a n case as mine a man may strain courtesy. n n Mer. That &#39;s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a n man to bow in the hams. n n Rom. Meaning, to cursy. n n Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it. n n Rom. A most courteous exposition. n n Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. n n Rom. Pink for flower. n n Mer. Right. n n Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower &#39;d. n n Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out n thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may n remain, after the wearing, solely singular. n n Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness! n n Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint. n n Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I &#39;ll cry a match. n n Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for n thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am n sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose? n n Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not n there for the goose. n n Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest. n n Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not! n n Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce. n n Rom. And is it not, then, well serv &#39;d in to a sweet goose? n n Mer. O, here &#39;s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch n narrow to an ell broad! n n Rom. I stretch it out for that word &#39;broad, &#39; which, added to n the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. n n Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now n art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by n art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a n great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in n a hole. n n Ben. Stop there, stop there! n n Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. n n Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. n n Mer. O, thou art deceiv &#39;d! I would have made it short; for I n was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to n occupy the argument no longer. n n Rom. Here &#39;s goodly gear! n n Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter]. n n n Mer. A sail, a sail! n n Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock. n n Nurse. Peter! n n Peter. Anon. n n Nurse. My fan, Peter. n n Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan &#39;s the fairer face of n the two. n n Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen. n n Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman. n n Nurse. Is it good-den? n n Mer. &#39;Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is n now upon the prick of noon. n n Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you! n n Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar. n n Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. &#39;For himself to mar, &#39; n quoth &#39;a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the n young Romeo? n n Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you n have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest n of that name, for fault of a worse. n n Nurse. You say well. n n Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i &#39; faith! wisely, n wisely. n n Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you. n n Ben. She will endite him to some supper. n n Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho! n n Rom. What hast thou found? n n Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is n something stale and hoar ere it be spent n He walks by them and sings. n n An old hare hoar, n And an old hare hoar, n Is very good meat in Lent; n But a hare that is hoar n Is too much for a score n When it hoars ere it be spent. n n Romeo, will you come to your father &#39;s? We &#39;ll to dinner thither. n n Rom. I will follow you. n n Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell, n [sings] lady, lady, lady. n Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio. n n Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant n was this that was so full of his ropery? n n Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and n will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month. n n Nurse. An &#39;a speak anything against me, I &#39;ll take him down, an n &#39;a n were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot, n I &#39;ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his n flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must n stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure! n n Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my n weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as n soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the n law on my side. n n Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me n quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you, n my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I n will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead n her into a fool &#39;s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of n behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and n therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were n an ill thing to be off &#39;red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. n n Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto n thee- n n Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord, n Lord! she will be a joyful woman. n n Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me. n n Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I n take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. n n Rom. Bid her devise n Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; n And there she shall at Friar Laurence &#39; cell n Be shriv &#39;d and married. Here is for thy pains. n n Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny. n n Rom. Go to! I say you shall. n n Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there. n n Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall. n Within this hour my man shall be with thee n And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, n Which to the high topgallant of my joy n Must be my convoy in the secret night. n Farewell. Be trusty, and I &#39;ll quit thy pains. n Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress. n n Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir. n n Rom. What say &#39;st thou, my dear nurse? n n Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne &#39;er hear say, n Two may keep counsel, putting one away? n n Rom. I warrant thee my man &#39;s as true as steel. n n Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! n when &#39;twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in n town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, n good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I n anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; n but I &#39;ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any n clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both n with a letter? n n Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R. n n Nurse. Ah, mocker! that &#39;s the dog &#39;s name. R is for the- No; I n know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest n sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you n good to hear it. n n Rom. Commend me to thy lady. n n Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter! n n Peter. Anon. n n Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene V. n Capulet &#39;s orchard. n n Enter Juliet. n n n Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; n In half an hour she &#39;promis &#39;d to return. n Perchance she cannot meet him. That &#39;s not so. n O, she is lame! Love &#39;s heralds should be thoughts, n Which ten times faster glide than the sun &#39;s beams n Driving back shadows over low &#39;ring hills. n Therefore do nimble-pinion &#39;d doves draw Love, n And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. n Now is the sun upon the highmost hill n Of this day &#39;s journey, and from nine till twelve n Is three long hours; yet she is not come. n Had she affections and warm youthful blood, n She would be as swift in motion as a ball; n My words would bandy her to my sweet love, n And his to me, n But old folks, many feign as they were dead- n Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. n n Enter Nurse [and Peter]. n n O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news? n Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. n n Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate. n [Exit Peter.] n n Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look &#39;st thou sad? n Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; n If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news n By playing it to me with so sour a face. n n Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile. n Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had! n n Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news. n Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak. n n Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile? n Do you not see that I am out of breath? n n Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath n To say to me that thou art out of breath? n The excuse that thou dost make in this delay n Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. n Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that. n Say either, and I &#39;ll stay the circumstance. n Let me be satisfied, is &#39;t good or bad? n n Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to n choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better n than any man &#39;s, yet his leg excels all men &#39;s; and for a hand and a n foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk &#39;d on, yet n they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I &#39;ll n warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve n God. n What, have you din &#39;d at home? n n Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before. n What says he of our marriage? What of that? n n Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I! n It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. n My back o &#39; t &#39; other side,- ah, my back, my back! n Beshrew your heart for sending me about n To catch my death with jauncing up and down! n n Jul. I &#39; faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. n Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? n n Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, n and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where n is your mother? n n Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within. n Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest! n &#39;Your love says, like an honest gentleman, n &#34;Where is your mother?&#34; &#39; n n Nurse. O God &#39;s Lady dear! n Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow. n Is this the poultice for my aching bones? n Henceforward do your messages yourself. n n Jul. Here &#39;s such a coil! Come, what says Romeo? n n Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? n n Jul. I have. n n Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence &#39; cell; n There stays a husband to make you a wife. n Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks: n They &#39;ll be in scarlet straight at any news. n Hie you to church; I must another way, n To fetch a ladder, by the which your love n Must climb a bird &#39;s nest soon when it is dark. n I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; n But you shall bear the burthen soon at night. n Go; I &#39;ll to dinner; hie you to the cell. n n Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene VI. n Friar Laurence &#39;s cell. n n Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo. n n n Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act n That after-hours with sorrow chide us not! n n Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can, n It cannot countervail the exchange of joy n That one short minute gives me in her sight. n Do thou but close our hands with holy words, n Then love-devouring death do what he dare- n It is enough I may but call her mine. n n Friar. These violent delights have violent ends n And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, n Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey n Is loathsome in his own deliciousness n And in the taste confounds the appetite. n Therefore love moderately: long love doth so; n Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. n n Enter Juliet. n n Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot n Will ne &#39;er wear out the everlasting flint. n A lover may bestride the gossamer n That idles in the wanton summer air, n And yet not fall; so light is vanity. n n Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor. n n Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. n n Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much. n n Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy n Be heap &#39;d like mine, and that thy skill be more n To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath n This neighbour air, and let rich music &#39;s tongue n Unfold the imagin &#39;d happiness that both n Receive in either by this dear encounter. n n Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, n Brags of his substance, not of ornament. n They are but beggars that can count their worth; n But my true love is grown to such excess n cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. n n Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work; n For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone n Till Holy Church incorporate two in one. n [Exeunt.] n n n n n ACT III. Scene I. n A public place. n n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men. n n n Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let &#39;s retire. n The day is hot, the Capulets abroad. n And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl, n For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. n n Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters n the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and n says &#39;God send me no need of thee! &#39; and by the operation of the n second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. n n Ben. Am I like such a fellow? n n Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in n Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be n moved. n n Ben. And what to? n n Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, n for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a n man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. n Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no n other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an n eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels n as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as n addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell &#39;d with a n man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog n that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a n tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with n another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt n tutor me from quarrelling! n n Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should n buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. n n Mer. The fee simple? O simple! n n Enter Tybalt and others. n n n Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets. n n Mer. By my heel, I care not. n n Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them. n Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you. n n Mer. And but one word with one of us? n Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow. n n Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me n occasion. n n Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving n n Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. n n Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make n minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here &#39;s my n fiddlestick; here &#39;s that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort! n n Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men. n Either withdraw unto some private place n And reason coldly of your grievances, n Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us. n n Mer. Men &#39;s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. n I will not budge for no man &#39;s pleasure, n n Enter Romeo. n n n Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man. n n Mer. But I &#39;ll be hang &#39;d, sir, if he wear your livery. n Marry, go before to field, he &#39;ll be your follower! n Your worship in that sense may call him man. n n Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford n No better term than this: thou art a villain. n n Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee n Doth much excuse the appertaining rage n To such a greeting. Villain am I none. n Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not. n n Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries n That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. n n Rom. I do protest I never injur &#39;d thee, n But love thee better than thou canst devise n Till thou shalt know the reason of my love; n And so good Capulet, which name I tender n As dearly as mine own, be satisfied. n n Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! n Alla stoccata carries it away. [Draws.] n Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk? n n Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me? n n Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. n That I n mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, n n dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out n of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your n ears ere it be out. n n Tyb. I am for you. [Draws.] n n Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up. n n Mer. Come, sir, your passado! n [They fight.] n n Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. n Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage! n Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath n Forbid this bandying in Verona streets. n Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio! n Tybalt under Romeo &#39;s arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies n [with his Followers]. n n Mer. I am hurt. n A plague o &#39; both your houses! I am sped. n Is he gone and hath nothing? n n Ben. What, art thou hurt? n n Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, &#39;tis enough. n Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon. n [Exit Page.] n n Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much. n n Mer. No, &#39;tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; n but &#39;tis enough, &#39;twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you n shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this n world. A plague o &#39; both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a n mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, n a n villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil n came you between us? I was hurt under your arm. n n Rom. I thought all for the best. n n Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio, n Or I shall faint. A plague o &#39; both your houses! n They have made worms &#39; meat of me. I have it, n And soundly too. Your houses! n [Exit. [supported by Benvolio]. n n Rom. This gentleman, the Prince &#39;s near ally, n My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt n In my behalf- my reputation stain &#39;d n With Tybalt &#39;s slander- Tybalt, that an hour n Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet, n Thy beauty hath made me effeminate n And in my temper soft &#39;ned valour &#39;s steel n n Enter Benvolio. n n n Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio &#39;s dead! n That gallant spirit hath aspir &#39;d the clouds, n Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. n n Rom. This day &#39;s black fate on moe days doth depend; n This but begins the woe others must end. n n Enter Tybalt. n n n Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. n n Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain? n Away to heaven respective lenity, n And fire-ey &#39;d fury be my conduct now! n Now, Tybalt, take the &#39;villain &#39; back again n That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio &#39;s soul n Is but a little way above our heads, n Staying for thine to keep him company. n Either thou or I, or both, must go with him. n n Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, n Shalt with him hence. n n Rom. This shall determine that. n They fight. Tybalt falls. n n Ben. Romeo, away, be gone! n The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. n Stand not amaz &#39;d. The Prince will doom thee death n If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away! n n Rom. O, I am fortune &#39;s fool! n n Ben. Why dost thou stay? n Exit Romeo. n Enter Citizens. n n n Citizen. Which way ran he that kill &#39;d Mercutio? n Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he? n n Ben. There lies that Tybalt. n n Citizen. Up, sir, go with me. n I charge thee in the Prince &#39;s name obey. n n n Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives, n and [others]. n n n Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray? n n Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all n The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. n There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, n That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. n n Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother &#39;s child! n O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill &#39;d n Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, n For blood of ours shed blood of Montague. n O cousin, cousin! n n Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? n n Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo &#39;s hand did stay. n Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink n How nice the quarrel was, and urg &#39;d withal n Your high displeasure. All this- uttered n With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow &#39;d- n Could not take truce with the unruly spleen n Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts n With piercing steel at bold Mercutio &#39;s breast; n Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, n And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats n Cold death aside and with the other sends n It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity n Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud, n &#39;Hold, friends! friends, part! &#39; and swifter than his tongue, n His agile arm beats down their fatal points, n And &#39;twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm n An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life n Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; n But by-and-by comes back to Romeo, n Who had but newly entertain &#39;d revenge, n And to &#39;t they go like lightning; for, ere I n Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain; n And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. n This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. n n Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague; n Affection makes him false, he speaks not true. n Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, n And all those twenty could but kill one life. n I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give. n Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live. n n Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio. n Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? n n Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio &#39;s friend; n His fault concludes but what the law should end, n The life of Tybalt. n n Prince. And for that offence n Immediately we do exile him hence. n I have an interest in your hate &#39;s proceeding, n My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; n But I &#39;ll amerce you with so strong a fine n That you shall all repent the loss of mine. n I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; n Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. n Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, n Else, when he is found, that hour is his last. n Bear hence this body, and attend our will. n Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene II. n Capulet &#39;s orchard. n n Enter Juliet alone. n n n Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, n Towards Phoebus &#39; lodging! Such a wagoner n As Phaeton would whip you to the West n And bring in cloudy night immediately. n Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, n That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo n Leap to these arms untalk &#39;d of and unseen. n Lovers can see to do their amorous rites n By their own beauties; or, if love be blind, n It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, n Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, n And learn me how to lose a winning match, n Play &#39;d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods. n Hood my unmann &#39;d blood, bating in my cheeks, n With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold, n Think true love acted simple modesty. n Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night; n For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night n Whiter than new snow upon a raven &#39;s back. n Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow &#39;d night; n Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die, n Take him and cut him out in little stars, n And he will make the face of heaven so fine n That all the world will be in love with night n And pay no worship to the garish sun. n O, I have bought the mansion of a love, n But not possess &#39;d it; and though I am sold, n Not yet enjoy &#39;d. So tedious is this day n As is the night before some festival n To an impatient child that hath new robes n And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse, n n Enter Nurse, with cords. n n And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks n But Romeo &#39;s name speaks heavenly eloquence. n Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords n That Romeo bid thee fetch? n n Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords. n [Throws them down.] n n Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands n n Nurse. Ah, weraday! he &#39;s dead, he &#39;s dead, he &#39;s dead! n We are undone, lady, we are undone! n Alack the day! he &#39;s gone, he &#39;s kill &#39;d, he &#39;s dead! n n Jul. Can heaven be so envious? n n Nurse. Romeo can, n Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo! n Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! n n Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus? n This torture should be roar &#39;d in dismal hell. n Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but &#39;I, &#39; n And that bare vowel &#39;I &#39; shall poison more n Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice. n I am not I, if there be such an &#39;I &#39;; n Or those eyes shut that make thee answer &#39;I. &#39; n If he be slain, say &#39;I &#39;; or if not, &#39;no. &#39; n Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. n n Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes, n (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast. n A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; n Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub &#39;d in blood, n All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight. n n Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once! n To prison, eyes; ne &#39;er look on liberty! n Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here, n And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier! n n Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! n O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman n That ever I should live to see thee dead! n n Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary? n Is Romeo slaught &#39;red, and is Tybalt dead? n My dear-lov &#39;d cousin, and my dearer lord? n Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! n For who is living, if those two are gone? n n Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; n Romeo that kill &#39;d him, he is banished. n n Jul. O God! Did Romeo &#39;s hand shed Tybalt &#39;s blood? n n Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did! n n Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow &#39;ring face! n Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? n Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! n Dove-feather &#39;d raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! n Despised substance of divinest show! n Just opposite to what thou justly seem &#39;st- n A damned saint, an honourable villain! n O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell n When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend n In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? n Was ever book containing such vile matter n So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell n In such a gorgeous palace! n n Nurse. There &#39;s no trust, n No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur &#39;d, n All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. n Ah, where &#39;s my man? Give me some aqua vitae. n These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. n Shame come to Romeo! n n Jul. Blister &#39;d be thy tongue n For such a wish! He was not born to shame. n Upon his brow shame is asham &#39;d to sit; n For &#39;tis a throne where honour may be crown &#39;d n Sole monarch of the universal earth. n O, what a beast was I to chide at him! n n Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill &#39;d your cousin? n n Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? n Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name n When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? n But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? n That villain cousin would have kill &#39;d my husband. n Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring! n Your tributary drops belong to woe, n Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. n My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain; n And Tybalt &#39;s dead, that would have slain my husband. n All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then? n Some word there was, worser than Tybalt &#39;s death, n That murd &#39;red me. I would forget it fain; n But O, it presses to my memory n Like damned guilty deeds to sinners &#39; minds! n &#39;Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished. &#39; n That &#39;banished, &#39; that one word &#39;banished, &#39; n Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt &#39;s death n Was woe enough, if it had ended there; n Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship n And needly will be rank &#39;d with other griefs, n Why followed not, when she said &#39;Tybalt &#39;s dead, &#39; n Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, n Which modern lamentation might have mov &#39;d? n But with a rearward following Tybalt &#39;s death, n &#39;Romeo is banished &#39;- to speak that word n Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, n All slain, all dead. &#39;Romeo is banished &#39;- n There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, n In that word &#39;s death; no words can that woe sound. n Where is my father and my mother, nurse? n n Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt &#39;s corse. n Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. n n Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent, n When theirs are dry, for Romeo &#39;s banishment. n Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil &#39;d, n Both you and I, for Romeo is exil &#39;d. n He made you for a highway to my bed; n But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. n Come, cords; come, nurse. I &#39;ll to my wedding bed; n And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! n n Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I &#39;ll find Romeo n To comfort you. I wot well where he is. n Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night. n I &#39;ll to him; he is hid at Laurence &#39; cell. n n Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight n And bid him come to take his last farewell. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene III. n Friar Laurence &#39;s cell. n n Enter Friar [Laurence]. n n n Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man. n Affliction is enanmour &#39;d of thy parts, n And thou art wedded to calamity. n n Enter Romeo. n n n Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince &#39;s doom n What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand n That I yet know not? n n Friar. Too familiar n Is my dear son with such sour company. n I bring thee tidings of the Prince &#39;s doom. n n Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince &#39;s doom? n n Friar. A gentler judgment vanish &#39;d from his lips- n Not body &#39;s death, but body &#39;s banishment. n n Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say &#39;death &#39;; n For exile hath more terror in his look, n Much more than death. Do not say &#39;banishment. &#39; n n Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished. n Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. n n Rom. There is no world without Verona walls, n But purgatory, torture, hell itself. n Hence banished is banish &#39;d from the world, n And world &#39;s exile is death. Then &#39;banishment &#39; n Is death misterm &#39;d. Calling death &#39;banishment, &#39; n Thou cut &#39;st my head off with a golden axe n And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. n n Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness! n Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince, n Taking thy part, hath rush &#39;d aside the law, n And turn &#39;d that black word death to banishment. n This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. n n Rom. &#39;Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here, n Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog n And little mouse, every unworthy thing, n Live here in heaven and may look on her; n But Romeo may not. More validity, n More honourable state, more courtship lives n In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize n On the white wonder of dear Juliet &#39;s hand n And steal immortal blessing from her lips, n Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, n Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; n But Romeo may not- he is banished. n This may flies do, when I from this must fly; n They are free men, but I am banished. n And sayest thou yet that exile is not death? n Hadst thou no poison mix &#39;d, no sharp-ground knife, n No sudden mean of death, though ne &#39;er so mean, n But &#39;banished &#39; to kill me- &#39;banished &#39;? n O friar, the damned use that word in hell; n Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart, n Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, n A sin-absolver, and my friend profess &#39;d, n To mangle me with that word &#39;banished &#39;? n n Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak. n n Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. n n Friar. I &#39;ll give thee armour to keep off that word; n Adversity &#39;s sweet milk, philosophy, n To comfort thee, though thou art banished. n n Rom. Yet &#39;banished &#39;? Hang up philosophy! n Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, n Displant a town, reverse a prince &#39;s doom, n It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more. n n Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears. n n Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? n n Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. n n Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel. n Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, n An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, n Doting like me, and like me banished, n Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, n And fall upon the ground, as I do now, n Taking the measure of an unmade grave. n Knock [within]. n n Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself. n n Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans, n Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. Knock. n n Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who &#39;s there? Romeo, arise; n Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up; Knock. n Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God &#39;s will, n What simpleness is this.- I come, I come! Knock. n Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What &#39;s your will n n Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand. n I come from Lady Juliet. n n Friar. Welcome then. n n Enter Nurse. n n n Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar n Where is my lady &#39;s lord, where &#39;s Romeo? n n Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. n n Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress &#39; case, n Just in her case! n n Friar. O woeful sympathy! n Piteous predicament! n n Nurse. Even so lies she, n Blubb &#39;ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering. n Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man. n For Juliet &#39;s sake, for her sake, rise and stand! n Why should you fall into so deep an O? n n Rom. (rises) Nurse- n n Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death &#39;s the end of all. n n Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her? n Doth not she think me an old murtherer, n Now I have stain &#39;d the childhood of our joy n With blood remov &#39;d but little from her own? n Where is she? and how doth she! and what says n My conceal &#39;d lady to our cancell &#39;d love? n n Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; n And now falls on her bed, and then starts up, n And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries, n And then down falls again. n n Rom. As if that name, n Shot from the deadly level of a gun, n Did murther her; as that name &#39;s cursed hand n Murder &#39;d her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me, n In what vile part of this anatomy n Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack n The hateful mansion. [Draws his dagger.] n n Friar. Hold thy desperate hand. n Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art; n Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote n The unreasonable fury of a beast. n Unseemly woman in a seeming man! n Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! n Thou hast amaz &#39;d me. By my holy order, n I thought thy disposition better temper &#39;d. n Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself? n And slay thy lady that in thy life lives, n By doing damned hate upon thyself? n Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? n Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet n In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. n Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, n Which, like a usurer, abound &#39;st in all, n And usest none in that true use indeed n Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. n Thy noble shape is but a form of wax n Digressing from the valour of a man; n Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, n Killing that love which thou hast vow &#39;d to cherish; n Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, n Misshapen in the conduct of them both, n Like powder in a skilless soldier &#39;s flask, n is get afire by thine own ignorance, n And thou dismemb &#39;red with thine own defence. n What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive, n For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead. n There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee, n But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too. n The law, that threat &#39;ned death, becomes thy friend n And turns it to exile. There art thou happy. n A pack of blessings light upon thy back; n Happiness courts thee in her best array; n But, like a misbhav &#39;d and sullen wench, n Thou pout &#39;st upon thy fortune and thy love. n Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. n Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed, n Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her. n But look thou stay not till the watch be set, n For then thou canst not pass to Mantua, n Where thou shalt live till we can find a time n To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, n Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back n With twenty hundred thousand times more joy n Than thou went &#39;st forth in lamentation. n Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady, n And bid her hasten all the house to bed, n Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto. n Romeo is coming. n n Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay &#39;d here all the night n To hear good counsel. O, what learning is! n My lord, I &#39;ll tell my lady you will come. n n Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. n n Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir. n Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. Exit. n n Rom. How well my comfort is reviv &#39;d by this! n n Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state: n Either be gone before the watch be set, n Or by the break of day disguis &#39;d from hence. n Sojourn in Mantua. I &#39;ll find out your man, n And he shall signify from time to time n Every good hap to you that chances here. n Give me thy hand. &#39;Tis late. Farewell; good night. n n Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me, n It were a grief so brief to part with thee. n Farewell. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene IV. n Capulet &#39;s house n n Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris. n n n Cap. Things have fall &#39;n out, sir, so unluckily n That we have had no time to move our daughter. n Look you, she lov &#39;d her kinsman Tybalt dearly, n And so did I. Well, we were born to die. n &#39;Tis very late; she &#39;ll not come down to-night. n I promise you, but for your company, n I would have been abed an hour ago. n n Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo. n Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter. n n Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; n To-night she &#39;s mew &#39;d up to her heaviness. n n Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender n Of my child &#39;s love. I think she will be rul &#39;d n In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not. n Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; n Acquaint her here of my son Paris &#39; love n And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next- n But, soft! what day is this? n n Par. Monday, my lord. n n Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon. n Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her n She shall be married to this noble earl. n Will you be ready? Do you like this haste? n We &#39;ll keep no great ado- a friend or two; n For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, n It may be thought we held him carelessly, n Being our kinsman, if we revel much. n Therefore we &#39;ll have some half a dozen friends, n And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? n n Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow. n n Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then. n Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed; n Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day. n Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho! n Afore me, It is so very very late n That we may call it early by-and-by. n Good night. n Exeunt n n n n n Scene V. n Capulet &#39;s orchard. n n Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window. n n n Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day. n It was the nightingale, and not the lark, n That pierc &#39;d the fearful hollow of thine ear. n Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree. n Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. n n Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn; n No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks n Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East. n Night &#39;s candles are burnt out, and jocund day n Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. n I must be gone and live, or stay and die. n n Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I. n It is some meteor that the sun exhales n To be to thee this night a torchbearer n And light thee on the way to Mantua. n Therefore stay yet; thou need &#39;st not to be gone. n n Rom. Let me be ta &#39;en, let me be put to death. n I am content, so thou wilt have it so. n I &#39;ll say yon grey is not the morning &#39;s eye, n &#39;Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia &#39;s brow; n Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat n The vaulty heaven so high above our heads. n I have more care to stay than will to go. n Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. n How is &#39;t, my soul? Let &#39;s talk; it is not day. n n Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away! n It is the lark that sings so out of tune, n Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. n Some say the lark makes sweet division; n This doth not so, for she divideth us. n Some say the lark and loathed toad chang &#39;d eyes; n O, now I would they had chang &#39;d voices too, n Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, n Hunting thee hence with hunt &#39;s-up to the day! n O, now be gone! More light and light it grows. n n Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes! n n Enter Nurse. n n n Nurse. Madam! n n Jul. Nurse? n n Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber. n The day is broke; be wary, look about. n n Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out. n [Exit.] n n Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I &#39;ll descend. n He goeth down. n n Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend? n I must hear from thee every day in the hour, n For in a minute there are many days. n O, by this count I shall be much in years n Ere I again behold my Romeo! n n Rom. Farewell! n I will omit no opportunity n That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. n n Jul. O, think &#39;st thou we shall ever meet again? n n Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve n For sweet discourses in our time to come. n n Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul! n Methinks I see thee, now thou art below, n As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. n Either my eyesight fails, or thou look &#39;st pale. n n Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you. n Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu! n Exit. n n Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle. n If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him n That is renown &#39;d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune, n For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long n But send him back. n n Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up? n n Jul. Who is &#39;t that calls? It is my lady mother. n Is she not down so late, or up so early? n What unaccustom &#39;d cause procures her hither? n n Enter Mother. n n n Lady. Why, how now, Juliet? n n Jul. Madam, I am not well. n n Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin &#39;s death? n What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? n An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live. n Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love; n But much of grief shows still some want of wit. n n Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. n n Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend n Which you weep for. n n Jul. Feeling so the loss, n I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. n n Lady. Well, girl, thou weep &#39;st not so much for his death n As that the villain lives which slaughter &#39;d him. n n Jul. What villain, madam? n n Lady. That same villain Romeo. n n Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.- n God pardon him! I do, with all my heart; n And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. n n Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives. n n Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. n Would none but I might venge my cousin &#39;s death! n n Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not. n Then weep no more. I &#39;ll send to one in Mantua, n Where that same banish &#39;d runagate doth live, n Shall give him such an unaccustom &#39;d dram n That he shall soon keep Tybalt company; n And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied. n n Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied n With Romeo till I behold him- dead- n Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex &#39;d. n Madam, if you could find out but a man n To bear a poison, I would temper it; n That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, n Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors n To hear him nam &#39;d and cannot come to him, n To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt n Upon his body that hath slaughter &#39;d him! n n Lady. Find thou the means, and I &#39;ll find such a man. n But now I &#39;ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. n n Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time. n What are they, I beseech your ladyship? n n Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; n One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, n Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy n That thou expects not nor I look &#39;d not for. n n Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that? n n Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn n The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, n The County Paris, at Saint Peter &#39;s Church, n Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. n n Jul. Now by Saint Peter &#39;s Church, and Peter too, n He shall not make me there a joyful bride! n I wonder at this haste, that I must wed n Ere he that should be husband comes to woo. n I pray you tell my lord and father, madam, n I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear n It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, n Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! n n Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself, n And see how he will take it at your hands. n n Enter Capulet and Nurse. n n n Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, n But for the sunset of my brother &#39;s son n It rains downright. n How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears? n Evermore show &#39;ring? In one little body n Thou counterfeit &#39;st a bark, a sea, a wind: n For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, n Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is n Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs, n Who, raging with thy tears and they with them, n Without a sudden calm will overset n Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife? n Have you delivered to her our decree? n n Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. n I would the fool were married to her grave! n n Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. n How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks? n Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, n Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought n So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? n n Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. n Proud can I never be of what I hate, n But thankful even for hate that is meant love. n n Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this? n &#39;Proud &#39;- and &#39;I thank you &#39;- and &#39;I thank you not &#39;- n And yet &#39;not proud &#39;? Mistress minion you, n Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, n But fettle your fine joints &#39;gainst Thursday next n To go with Paris to Saint Peter &#39;s Church, n Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. n Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage! n You tallow-face! n n Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad? n n Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees, n Hear me with patience but to speak a word. n n Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! n I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday n Or never after look me in the face. n Speak not, reply not, do not answer me! n My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest n That God had lent us but this only child; n But now I see this one is one too much, n And that we have a curse in having her. n Out on her, hilding! n n Nurse. God in heaven bless her! n You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. n n Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue, n Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go! n n Nurse. I speak no treason. n n Cap. O, God-i-god-en! n n Nurse. May not one speak? n n Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool! n Utter your gravity o &#39;er a gossip &#39;s bowl, n For here we need it not. n n Lady. You are too hot. n n Cap. God &#39;s bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early, n At home, abroad, alone, in company, n Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been n To have her match &#39;d; and having now provided n A gentleman of princely parentage, n Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train &#39;d, n Stuff &#39;d, as they say, with honourable parts, n Proportion &#39;d as one &#39;s thought would wish a man- n And then to have a wretched puling fool, n A whining mammet, in her fortune &#39;s tender, n To answer &#39;I &#39;ll not wed, I cannot love; n I am too young, I pray you pardon me &#39;! n But, an you will not wed, I &#39;ll pardon you. n Graze where you will, you shall not house with me. n Look to &#39;t, think on &#39;t; I do not use to jest. n Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: n An you be mine, I &#39;ll give you to my friend; n An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, n For, by my soul, I &#39;ll ne &#39;er acknowledge thee, n Nor what is mine shall never do thee good. n Trust to &#39;t. Bethink you. I &#39;ll not be forsworn. Exit. n n Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds n That sees into the bottom of my grief? n O sweet my mother, cast me not away! n Delay this marriage for a month, a week; n Or if you do not, make the bridal bed n In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. n n Lady. Talk not to me, for I &#39;ll not speak a word. n Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. Exit. n n Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented? n My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven. n How shall that faith return again to earth n Unless that husband send it me from heaven n By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me. n Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems n Upon so soft a subject as myself! n What say &#39;st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? n Some comfort, nurse. n n Nurse. Faith, here it is. n Romeo is banish &#39;d; and all the world to nothing n That he dares ne &#39;er come back to challenge you; n Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth. n Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, n I think it best you married with the County. n O, he &#39;s a lovely gentleman! n Romeo &#39;s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, n Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye n As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, n I think you are happy in this second match, n For it excels your first; or if it did not, n Your first is dead- or &#39;twere as good he were n As living here and you no use of him. n n Jul. Speak &#39;st thou this from thy heart? n n Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both. n n Jul. Amen! n n Nurse. What? n n Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. n Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, n Having displeas &#39;d my father, to Laurence &#39; cell, n To make confession and to be absolv &#39;d. n n Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. Exit. n n Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! n Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, n Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue n Which she hath prais &#39;d him with above compare n So many thousand times? Go, counsellor! n Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. n I &#39;ll to the friar to know his remedy. n If all else fail, myself have power to die. Exit. n n n n n ACT IV. Scene I. n Friar Laurence &#39;s cell. n n Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris. n n n Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short. n n Par. My father Capulet will have it so, n And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. n n Friar. You say you do not know the lady &#39;s mind. n Uneven is the course; I like it not. n n Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt &#39;s death, n And therefore have I little talk &#39;d of love; n For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. n Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous n That she do give her sorrow so much sway, n And in his wisdom hastes our marriage n To stop the inundation of her tears, n Which, too much minded by herself alone, n May be put from her by society. n Now do you know the reason of this haste. n n Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow &#39;d.- n Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. n n Enter Juliet. n n n Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife! n n Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. n n Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. n n Jul. What must be shall be. n n Friar. That &#39;s a certain text. n n Par. Come you to make confession to this father? n n Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you. n n Par. Do not deny to him that you love me. n n Jul. I will confess to you that I love him. n n Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. n n Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price, n Being spoke behind your back, than to your face. n n Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus &#39;d with tears. n n Jul. The tears have got small victory by that, n For it was bad enough before their spite. n n Par. Thou wrong &#39;st it more than tears with that report. n n Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth; n And what I spake, I spake it to my face. n n Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland &#39;red it. n n Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own. n Are you at leisure, holy father, now, n Or shall I come to you at evening mass n n Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. n My lord, we must entreat the time alone. n n Par. God shield I should disturb devotion! n Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye. n Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Exit. n n Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so, n Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help! n n Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; n It strains me past the compass of my wits. n I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, n On Thursday next be married to this County. n n Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear &#39;st of this, n Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. n If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, n Do thou but call my resolution wise n And with this knife I &#39;ll help it presently. n God join &#39;d my heart and Romeo &#39;s, thou our hands; n And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo &#39;s seal &#39;d, n Shall be the label to another deed, n Or my true heart with treacherous revolt n Turn to another, this shall slay them both. n Therefore, out of thy long-experienc &#39;d time, n Give me some present counsel; or, behold, n &#39;Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife n Shall play the empire, arbitrating that n Which the commission of thy years and art n Could to no issue of true honour bring. n Be not so long to speak. I long to die n If what thou speak &#39;st speak not of remedy. n n Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, n Which craves as desperate an execution n As that is desperate which we would prevent. n If, rather than to marry County Paris n Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, n Then is it likely thou wilt undertake n A thing like death to chide away this shame, n That cop &#39;st with death himself to scape from it; n And, if thou dar &#39;st, I &#39;ll give thee remedy. n n Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, n From off the battlements of yonder tower, n Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk n Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears, n Or shut me nightly in a charnel house, n O &#39;ercover &#39;d quite with dead men &#39;s rattling bones, n With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; n Or bid me go into a new-made grave n And hide me with a dead man in his shroud- n Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble- n And I will do it without fear or doubt, n To live an unstain &#39;d wife to my sweet love. n n Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent n To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow. n To-morrow night look that thou lie alone; n Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. n Take thou this vial, being then in bed, n And this distilled liquor drink thou off; n When presently through all thy veins shall run n A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse n Shall keep his native progress, but surcease; n No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest; n The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade n To paly ashes, thy eyes &#39; windows fall n Like death when he shuts up the day of life; n Each part, depriv &#39;d of supple government, n Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death; n And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death n Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours, n And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. n Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes n To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. n Then, as the manner of our country is, n In thy best robes uncovered on the bier n Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault n Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. n In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, n Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift; n And hither shall he come; and he and I n Will watch thy waking, and that very night n Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. n And this shall free thee from this present shame, n If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear n Abate thy valour in the acting it. n n Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! n n Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous n In this resolve. I &#39;ll send a friar with speed n To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. n n Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford. n Farewell, dear father. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene II. n Capulet &#39;s house. n n Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen, n two or three. n n n Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ. n [Exit a Servingman.] n Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks. n n Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I &#39;ll try if they can n lick their fingers. n n Cap. How canst thou try them so? n n Serv. Marry, sir, &#39;tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own n fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not n with me. n n Cap. Go, begone. n Exit Servingman. n We shall be much unfurnish &#39;d for this time. n What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence? n n Nurse. Ay, forsooth. n n Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her. n A peevish self-will &#39;d harlotry it is. n n Enter Juliet. n n n Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look. n n Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding? n n Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin n Of disobedient opposition n To you and your behests, and am enjoin &#39;d n By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here n To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you! n Henceforward I am ever rul &#39;d by you. n n Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this. n I &#39;ll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning. n n Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence &#39; cell n And gave him what becomed love I might, n Not stepping o &#39;er the bounds of modesty. n n Cap. Why, I am glad on &#39;t. This is well. Stand up. n This is as &#39;t should be. Let me see the County. n Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither. n Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar, n All our whole city is much bound to him. n n Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet n To help me sort such needful ornaments n As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? n n Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough. n n Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We &#39;ll to church to-morrow. n Exeunt Juliet and Nurse. n n Mother. We shall be short in our provision. n &#39;Tis now near night. n n Cap. Tush, I will stir about, n And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife. n Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her. n I &#39;ll not to bed to-night; let me alone. n I &#39;ll play the housewife for this once. What, ho! n They are all forth; well, I will walk myself n To County Paris, to prepare him up n Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light, n Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim &#39;d. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene III. n Juliet &#39;s chamber. n n Enter Juliet and Nurse. n n n Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse, n I pray thee leave me to myself to-night; n For I have need of many orisons n To move the heavens to smile upon my state, n Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin. n n Enter Mother. n n n Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help? n n Jul. No, madam; we have cull &#39;d such necessaries n As are behooffull for our state to-morrow. n So please you, let me now be left alone, n And let the nurse this night sit up with you; n For I am sure you have your hands full all n In this so sudden business. n n Mother. Good night. n Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need. n Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.] n n Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again. n I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins n That almost freezes up the heat of life. n I &#39;ll call them back again to comfort me. n Nurse!- What should she do here? n My dismal scene I needs must act alone. n Come, vial. n What if this mixture do not work at all? n Shall I be married then to-morrow morning? n No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there. n Lays down a dagger. n What if it be a poison which the friar n Subtilly hath minist &#39;red to have me dead, n Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour &#39;d n Because he married me before to Romeo? n I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not, n For he hath still been tried a holy man. n I will not entertain so bad a thought. n How if, when I am laid into the tomb, n I wake before the time that Romeo n Come to redeem me? There &#39;s a fearful point! n Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, n To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, n And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? n Or, if I live, is it not very like n The horrible conceit of death and night, n Together with the terror of the place- n As in a vault, an ancient receptacle n Where for this many hundred years the bones n Of all my buried ancestors are pack &#39;d; n Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, n Lies fest &#39;ring in his shroud; where, as they say, n At some hours in the night spirits resort- n Alack, alack, is it not like that I, n So early waking- what with loathsome smells, n And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, n That living mortals, hearing them, run mad- n O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, n Environed with all these hideous fears, n And madly play with my forefathers &#39; joints, n And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud., n And, in this rage, with some great kinsman &#39;s bone n As with a club dash out my desp &#39;rate brains? n O, look! methinks I see my cousin &#39;s ghost n Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body n Upon a rapier &#39;s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay! n Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee. n n She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains. n n n n n Scene IV. n Capulet &#39;s house. n n Enter Lady of the House and Nurse. n n n Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse. n n Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry. n n Enter Old Capulet. n n n Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow &#39;d, n The curfew bell hath rung, &#39;tis three o &#39;clock. n Look to the bak &#39;d meats, good Angelica; n Spare not for cost. n n Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go, n Get you to bed! Faith, you &#39;ll be sick to-morrow n For this night &#39;s watching. n n Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch &#39;d ere now n All night for lesser cause, and ne &#39;er been sick. n n Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; n But I will watch you from such watching now. n Exeunt Lady and Nurse. n n Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood! n n n Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets. n n What is there? Now, fellow, n n Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what. n n Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier n logs. n Call Peter; he will show thee where they are. n n Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs n And never trouble Peter for the matter. n n Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha! n Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, &#39;tis day. n The County will be here with music straight, n For so he said he would. Play music. n I hear him near. n Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say! n n Enter Nurse. n Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up. n I &#39;ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste, n Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already: n Make haste, I say. n [Exeunt.] n n n n n Scene V. n Juliet &#39;s chamber. n n [Enter Nurse.] n n n Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she. n Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed! n Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride! n What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now! n Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, n The County Paris hath set up his rest n That you shall rest but little. God forgive me! n Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep! n I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam! n Ay, let the County take you in your bed! n He &#39;ll fright you up, i &#39; faith. Will it not be? n [Draws aside the curtains.] n What, dress &#39;d, and in your clothes, and down again? n I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady! n Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady &#39;s dead! n O weraday that ever I was born! n Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady! n n Enter Mother. n n n Mother. What noise is here? n n Nurse. O lamentable day! n n Mother. What is the matter? n n Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day! n n Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life! n Revive, look up, or I will die with thee! n Help, help! Call help. n n Enter Father. n n n Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come. n n Nurse. She &#39;s dead, deceas &#39;d; she &#39;s dead! Alack the day! n n Mother. Alack the day, she &#39;s dead, she &#39;s dead, she &#39;s dead! n n Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she &#39;s cold, n Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff; n Life and these lips have long been separated. n Death lies on her like an untimely frost n Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. n n Nurse. O lamentable day! n n Mother. O woful time! n n Cap. Death, that hath ta &#39;en her hence to make me wail, n Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak. n n n Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians. n n n Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church? n n Cap. Ready to go, but never to return. n O son, the night before thy wedding day n Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies, n Flower as she was, deflowered by him. n Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir; n My daughter he hath wedded. I will die n And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death &#39;s. n n Par. Have I thought long to see this morning &#39;s face, n And doth it give me such a sight as this? n n Mother. Accurs &#39;d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! n Most miserable hour that e &#39;er time saw n In lasting labour of his pilgrimage! n But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, n But one thing to rejoice and solace in, n And cruel Death hath catch &#39;d it from my sight! n n Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day! n Most lamentable day, most woful day n That ever ever I did yet behold! n O day! O day! O day! O hateful day! n Never was seen so black a day as this. n O woful day! O woful day! n n Par. Beguil &#39;d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain! n Most detestable Death, by thee beguil &#39;d, n By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown! n O love! O life! not life, but love in death n n Cap. Despis &#39;d, distressed, hated, martyr &#39;d, kill &#39;d! n Uncomfortable time, why cam &#39;st thou now n To murther, murther our solemnity? n O child! O child! my soul, and not my child! n Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead, n And with my child my joys are buried! n n Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion &#39;s cure lives not n In these confusions. Heaven and yourself n Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all, n And all the better is it for the maid. n Your part in her you could not keep from death, n But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. n The most you sought was her promotion, n For &#39;twas your heaven she should be advanc &#39;d; n And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc &#39;d n Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? n O, in this love, you love your child so ill n That you run mad, seeing that she is well. n She &#39;s not well married that lives married long, n But she &#39;s best married that dies married young. n Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary n On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, n In all her best array bear her to church; n For though fond nature bids us all lament, n Yet nature &#39;s tears are reason &#39;s merriment. n n Cap. All things that we ordained festival n Turn from their office to black funeral- n Our instruments to melancholy bells, n Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast; n Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change; n Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse; n And all things change them to the contrary. n n Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; n And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare n To follow this fair corse unto her grave. n The heavens do low &#39;r upon you for some ill; n Move them no more by crossing their high will. n Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse]. n 1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone. n n Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up! n For well you know this is a pitiful case. [Exit.] n 1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. n n Enter Peter. n n n Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, &#39;Heart &#39;s ease, &#39; &#39;Heart &#39;s ease &#39;! n O, an you will have me live, play &#39;Heart &#39;s ease. &#39; n 1. Mus. Why &#39;Heart &#39;s ease &#39; &#39;, n n Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays &#39;My heart is n full of woe. &#39; O, play me some merry dump to comfort me. n 1. Mus. Not a dump we! &#39;Tis no time to play now. n n Pet. You will not then? n 1. Mus. No. n n Pet. I will then give it you soundly. n 1. Mus. What will you give us? n n Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the n minstrel. n 1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature. n n Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature &#39;s dagger on your pate. n I will carry no crotchets. I &#39;ll re you, I &#39;ll fa you. Do you n note me? n 1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us. n 2.

I say &#39;silver sound &#39; because musicians sound for silver. n n Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost? n 3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say. n n Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you.

A street. n n Enter Romeo. n n n Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep n My dreams presage some joyful news at hand. n My bosom &#39;s lord sits lightly in his throne, n And all this day an unaccustom &#39;d spirit n Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. n I dreamt my lady came and found me dead n (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!) n And breath &#39;d such life with kisses in my lips n That I reviv &#39;d and was an emperor. n Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess &#39;d, n When but love &#39;s shadows are so rich in joy! n n Enter Romeo &#39;s Man Balthasar, booted. n n News from Verona! How now, Balthasar? n Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? n How doth my lady? Is my father well? n How fares my Juliet? That I ask again, n For nothing can be ill if she be well. n n Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill. n Her body sleeps in Capel &#39;s monument, n And her immortal part with angels lives. n I saw her laid low in her kindred &#39;s vault n And presently took post to tell it you. n O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, n Since you did leave it for my office, sir. n n Rom. Is it e &#39;en so? Then I defy you, stars! n Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper n And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night. n n Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience. n Your looks are pale and wild and do import n Some misadventure. n n Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv &#39;d. n Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do. n Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? n n Man. No, my good lord. n n Rom. No matter. Get thee gone n And hire those horses. I &#39;ll be with thee straight. n Exit [Balthasar]. n Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night. n Let &#39;s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift n To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! n I do remember an apothecary, n And hereabouts &#39;a dwells, which late I noted n In tatt &#39;red weeds, with overwhelming brows, n Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks, n Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; n And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, n An alligator stuff &#39;d, and other skins n Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves n A beggarly account of empty boxes, n Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, n Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses n Were thinly scattered, to make up a show. n Noting this penury, to myself I said, n &#39;An if a man did need a poison now n Whose sale is present death in Mantua, n Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him. &#39; n O, this same thought did but forerun my need, n And this same needy man must sell it me. n As I remember, this should be the house. n Being holiday, the beggar &#39;s shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary! n n Enter Apothecary. n n n Apoth. Who calls so loud? n n Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor. n Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have n A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear n As will disperse itself through all the veins n That the life-weary taker mall fall dead, n And that the trunk may be discharg &#39;d of breath n As violently as hasty powder fir &#39;d n Doth hurry from the fatal cannon &#39;s womb. n n Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua &#39;s law n Is death to any he that utters them. n n Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness n And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks, n Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, n Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back: n The world is not thy friend, nor the world &#39;s law; n The world affords no law to make thee rich; n Then be not poor, but break it and take this. n n Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents. n n Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will. n n Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will n And drink it off, and if you had the strength n Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. n n Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men &#39;s souls, n Doing more murther in this loathsome world, n Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. n I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. n Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh. n Come, cordial and not poison, go with me n To Juliet &#39;s grave; for there must I use thee. n Exeunt. n n n n n Scene II. n Verona. Friar Laurence &#39;s cell. n n Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence. n n n John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho! n n Enter Friar Laurence. n n n Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John. n Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo? n Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. n n John. Going to find a barefoot brother out, n One of our order, to associate me n Here in this city visiting the sick, n And finding him, the searchers of the town, n Suspecting that we both were in a house n Where the infectious pestilence did reign, n Seal &#39;d up the doors, and would not let us forth, n So that my speed to Mantua there was stay &#39;d. n n Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo? n n John. I could not send it- here it is again- n Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, n So fearful were they of infection. n n Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood, n The letter was not nice, but full of charge, n Of dear import; and the neglecting it n May do much danger. Friar John, go hence, n Get me an iron crow and bring it straight n Unto my cell. n n John. Brother, I &#39;ll go and bring it thee. Exit. n n Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone. n Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake. n She will beshrew me much that Romeo n Hath had no notice of these accidents; n But I will write again to Mantua, n And keep her at my cell till Romeo come- n Poor living corse, clos &#39;d in a dead man &#39;s tomb! Exit. n n n n n Scene III. n Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets. n n Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch]. n n n Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof. n Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. n Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, n Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground. n So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread n (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves) n But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, n As signal that thou hear &#39;st something approach. n Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. n n Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone n Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [Retires.] n n Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew n (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones) n Which with sweet water nightly I will dew; n Or, wanting that, with tears distill &#39;d by moans. n The obsequies that I for thee will keep n Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep. n Whistle Boy. n The boy gives warning something doth approach. n What cursed foot wanders this way to-night n To cross my obsequies and true love &#39;s rite? n What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile. [Retires.] n n Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock, n and a crow of iron. n n n Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. n Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning n See thou deliver it to my lord and father. n Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee, n Whate &#39;er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof n And do not interrupt me in my course. n Why I descend into this bed of death n Is partly to behold my lady &#39;s face, n But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger n A precious ring- a ring that I must use n In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. n But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry n In what I farther shall intend to do, n By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint n And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. n The time and my intents are savage-wild, n More fierce and more inexorable far n Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. n n Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. n n Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that. n Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow. n n Bal. [aside] For all this same, I &#39;ll hide me hereabout. n His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. [Retires.] n n Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, n Gorg &#39;d with the dearest morsel of the earth, n Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, n And in despite I &#39;ll cram thee with more food. n Romeo opens the tomb. n n Par. This is that banish &#39;d haughty Montague n That murd &#39;red my love &#39;s cousin- with which grief n It is supposed the fair creature died- n And here is come to do some villanous shame n To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. n Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague! n Can vengeance be pursu &#39;d further than death? n Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee. n Obey, and go with me; for thou must die. n n Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. n Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp &#39;rate man. n Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone; n Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, n But not another sin upon my head n By urging me to fury. O, be gone! n By heaven, I love thee better than myself, n For I come hither arm &#39;d against myself. n Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say n A madman &#39;s mercy bid thee run away. n n Par. I do defy thy, conjuration n And apprehend thee for a felon here. n n Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy! n They fight. n n Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. n [Exit. Paris falls.] n n Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful, n Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [Dies.] n n Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. n Mercutio &#39;s kinsman, noble County Paris! n What said my man when my betossed soul n Did not attend him as we rode? I think n He told me Paris should have married Juliet. n Said he not so? or did I dream it so? n Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet n To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, n One writ with me in sour misfortune &#39;s book! n I &#39;ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. n A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught &#39;red youth, n For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes n This vault a feasting presence full of light. n Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr &#39;d. n [Lays him in the tomb.] n How oft when men are at the point of death n Have they been merry! which their keepers call n A lightning before death. O, how may I n Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife! n Death, that hath suck &#39;d the honey of thy breath, n Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. n Thou art not conquer &#39;d. Beauty &#39;s ensign yet n Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, n And death &#39;s pale flag is not advanced there. n Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? n O, what more favour can I do to thee n Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain n To sunder his that was thine enemy? n Forgive me, cousin. &#39; Ah, dear Juliet, n Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe n That unsubstantial Death is amorous, n And that the lean abhorred monster keeps n Thee here in dark to be his paramour? n For fear of that I still will stay with thee n And never from this palace of dim night n Depart again. Here, here will I remain n With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here n Will I set up my everlasting rest n And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars n From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last! n Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you n The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss n A dateless bargain to engrossing death! n Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide! n Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on n The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark! n Here &#39;s to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary! n Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. Falls. n n Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade. n n n Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night n Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who &#39;s there? n n Bal. Here &#39;s one, a friend, and one that knows you well. n n Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend, n What torch is yond that vainly lends his light n To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern, n It burneth in the Capels &#39; monument. n n Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there &#39;s my master, n One that you love. n n Friar. Who is it? n n Bal. Romeo. n n Friar. How long hath he been there? n n Bal. Full half an hour. n n Friar. Go with me to the vault. n n Bal. I dare not, sir. n My master knows not but I am gone hence, n And fearfully did menace me with death n If I did stay to look on his intents. n n Friar. Stay then; I &#39;ll go alone. Fear comes upon me. n O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing. n n Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here, n I dreamt my master and another fought, n And that my master slew him. n n Friar. Romeo! n Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains n The stony entrance of this sepulchre? n What mean these masterless and gory swords n To lie discolour &#39;d by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.] n Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too? n And steep &#39;d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour n Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs. n Juliet rises. n n Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord? n I do remember well where I should be, n And there I am. Where is my Romeo? n n Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest n Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. n A greater power than we can contradict n Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. n Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; n And Paris too. Come, I &#39;ll dispose of thee n Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. n Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. n Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay. n n Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. n Exit [Friar]. n What &#39;s here? A cup, clos &#39;d in my true love &#39;s hand? n Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. n O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop n To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. n Haply some poison yet doth hang on them n To make me die with a restorative. [Kisses him.] n Thy lips are warm! n n Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way? n Yea, noise? Then I &#39;ll be brief. O happy dagger! n [Snatches Romeo &#39;s dagger.] n This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die. n She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo &#39;s body]. n n Enter [Paris &#39;s] Boy and Watch. n n n Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. n n Chief Watch. &#39;the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. n Go, some of you; whoe &#39;er you find attach. n [Exeunt some of the Watch.] n Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain; n And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, n Who here hath lain this two days buried. n Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets; n Raise up the Montagues; some others search. n [Exeunt others of the Watch.] n We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, n But the true ground of all these piteous woes n We cannot without circumstance descry. n n Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo &#39;s Man [Balthasar]. n n 2. Watch. Here &#39;s Romeo &#39;s man. We found him in the churchyard. n n Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. n n Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman. n n 3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps. n We took this mattock and this spade from him n As he was coming from this churchyard side. n n Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too. n n Enter the Prince [and Attendants]. n n n Prince. What misadventure is so early up, n That calls our person from our morning rest? n n Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others]. n n n Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad? n n Wife. The people in the street cry &#39;Romeo, &#39; n Some &#39;Juliet, &#39; and some &#39;Paris &#39;; and all run, n With open outcry, toward our monument. n n Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears? n n Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; n And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, n Warm and new kill &#39;d. n n Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. n n Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter &#39;d Romeo &#39;s man, n With instruments upon them fit to open n These dead men &#39;s tombs. n n Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! n This dagger hath mista &#39;en, for, lo, his house n Is empty on the back of Montague, n And it missheathed in my daughter &#39;s bosom! n n Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell n That warns my old age to a sepulchre. n n Enter Montague [and others]. n n n Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up n To see thy son and heir more early down. n n Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night! n Grief of my son &#39;s exile hath stopp &#39;d her breath. n What further woe conspires against mine age? n n Prince. Look, and thou shalt see. n n Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this, n To press before thy father to a grave? n n Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, n Till we can clear these ambiguities n And know their spring, their head, their true descent; n And then will I be general of your woes n And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, n And let mischance be slave to patience. n Bring forth the parties of suspicion. n n Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least, n Yet most suspected, as the time and place n Doth make against me, of this direful murther; n And here I stand, both to impeach and purge n Myself condemned and myself excus &#39;d. n n Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this. n n Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath n Is not so long as is a tedious tale. n Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; n And she, there dead, that Romeo &#39;s faithful wife. n I married them; and their stol &#39;n marriage day n Was Tybalt &#39;s doomsday, whose untimely death n Banish &#39;d the new-made bridegroom from this city; n For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin &#39;d. n You, to remove that siege of grief from her, n Betroth &#39;d and would have married her perforce n To County Paris. Then comes she to me n And with wild looks bid me devise some mean n To rid her from this second marriage, n Or in my cell there would she kill herself. n Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) n A sleeping potion; which so took effect n As I intended, for it wrought on her n The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo n That he should hither come as this dire night n To help to take her from her borrowed grave, n Being the time the potion &#39;s force should cease. n But he which bore my letter, Friar John, n Was stay &#39;d by accident, and yesternight n Return &#39;d my letter back. Then all alone n At the prefixed hour of her waking n Came I to take her from her kindred &#39;s vault; n Meaning to keep her closely at my cell n Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. n But when I came, some minute ere the time n Of her awaking, here untimely lay n The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. n She wakes; and I entreated her come forth n And bear this work of heaven with patience; n But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, n And she, too desperate, would not go with me, n But, as it seems, did violence on herself. n All this I know, and to the marriage n Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this n Miscarried by my fault, let my old life n Be sacrific &#39;d, some hour before his time, n Unto the rigour of severest law. n n Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man. n Where &#39;s Romeo &#39;s man? What can he say in this? n n Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet &#39;s death; n And then in post he came from Mantua n To this same place, to this same monument. n This letter he early bid me give his father, n And threat &#39;ned me with death, going in the vault, n If I departed not and left him there. n n Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it. n Where is the County &#39;s page that rais &#39;d the watch? n Sirrah, what made your master in this place? n n Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady &#39;s grave; n And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. n Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; n And by-and-by my master drew on him; n And then I ran away to call the watch. n n Prince. This letter doth make good the friar &#39;s words, n Their course of love, the tidings of her death; n And here he writes that he did buy a poison n Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal n Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. n Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage, n See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, n That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! n And I, for winking at you, discords too, n Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish &#39;d. n n Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. n This is my daughter &#39;s jointure, for no more n Can I demand. n n Mon. But I can give thee more; n For I will raise her Statue in pure gold, n That whiles Verona by that name is known, n There shall no figure at such rate be set n As that of true and faithful Juliet. n n Cap. As rich shall Romeo &#39;s by his lady &#39;s lie- n Poor sacrifices of our enmity! n n Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings. n The sun for sorrow will not show his head. n Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; n Some shall be pardon &#39;d, and some punished; n For never was a story of more woe n Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. n Exeunt omnes. n n THE END n n n n n n n n n End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare n n *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET *** n n ***** This file should be named 1112.txt or 1112.zip ***** n This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: n http://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/1/1112/ n n n n Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions n will be renamed. n n Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no n one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation n (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without n permission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project n Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure n and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. n To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation n and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 n and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org. n n n Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg n Literary Archive Foundation n n Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide n spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of n increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be n freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest n array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations n ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt n status with the IRS. n n The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating n charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United n States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a n considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up n with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations n where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To n SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any n particular state visit http://pglaf.org n n While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we n have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition n against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who n approach us with offers to donate. n n International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make n any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from n outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. n n Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation n methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other n ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. n To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate n n n Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic n works. n n Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm n concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared n with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project n Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. n n n Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed n editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. n unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily n keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. n n n Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: n n http://www.gutenberg.org n n This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, n including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary n Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to n subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. n&#39; .

Comment . &#39;love&#39;, Accurate. It&#39;s a love story. | &#39;night&#39;, Accurate. Most of the story happened at night. A lot conspiracy and secret moves. | &#39;death&#39;, Accurate. Most of people in the story died, and everybody was basically try to kill somebody or themselves. | &#39;good&#39;, Kind of accurate. From the original text, I found most common usage of the word &quot;good&quot;, mostly just giving others positive feedback using good. It could be a good deed from a servant, good plan(but bad motivation!) This book is not really that positive. Honestly even in the part that Romeo and Juliet was happy in love the word &quot;good&quot; is not used very often. | &#39;come&#39;, I don&#39;t know how to comment on the words(mostly verb) &quot;come&quot;, &quot;go&quot;,&quot;say&quot;, &quot;tell&quot;,&quot;make&quot;,&quot;let&quot;,&quot;give&quot;,&quot;know&quot;. There were many interactions in the book, but these words are the most most basic action words. | &#39;art&#39;, Accurate. Everybody was talking about art in the story. | &#39;day&#39;, This word appeared so much less than &quot;night&quot;. I think night is more accurate than day but yes there are still a lot scene in the day time. | &#39;work&#39;, this word is a bit disturbing because it appeared the most in footnote and things. The story use the work the most to express if something work out. | &#39;dead&#39;,Accurate. Again, everybody died. | &#39;fair&#39;, Honestly this is kind of like the word &quot;good&quot; here. Characters just talk in a polite way to depict something is pretty or not but not actual emotion or plot. | &#39;well&#39;, same as &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;good&quot;. | &#39;give&#39;, Fun fact there are so many &quot;give&quot; being used just to say &quot;give somebody thanks&quot; or other emotional words. I think it&#39;s pretty vague and not very accurate deliver the sense of the book. But at least it shows that people were talking very indirectly. | &#39;like&#39;, this word is also a bit vague because in the story, &quot;like&quot; was widely used as proposition and don&#39;t really have any meaning. | . A short reflection . I think I should check the word sense of the use of these words because obviously one word has many meaning and usages. But I don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s commonly needed, or if there&#39;s any way to conclude the type of usage of words in the article overall (for example, the word &quot;like&quot;, used as proposition 40 times in the text but only 5 times as adjective to show favor). . Another thing is I&#39;m encountered many most basic action words like &quot;come&quot;,&quot;go&quot;, how should we handle words like this. I didn&#39;t really find good explanations online. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
